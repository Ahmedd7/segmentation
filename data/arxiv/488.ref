[ 7 , 8 ] , where it is indicated that only explicit baryon_number_violation is sufficient . at energies and intensities accessible to modern laboratories , the cp_violating effect of θ ew which proceeds_via the electroweak instanton is severely_suppressed , and offers no hope of measuring the parameter . however , at the high_temperatures present in the early_universe , sphaleron rates are significantly_enhanced , and the electroweak_vacuum angle may provide a potentially large source of cp_violation for baryogenesis . recently [ 9 ] , the possibility that an axion associated_with θ ew might account for the cosmological_constant was explored . before_discussing the nature of the weak vacuum angle , we_briefly_review the situation concerning the qcd_vacuum angle in the strong sector . as is well - known the cp - violating term in the qcd_lagrangian however , with non - zero quark_masses the axial_symmetry is explicitly_broken . thus , one accomplishes only in transferring θ qcd from the topological term in eq . ( 1 ) into the quark_mass matrix , as indicated by the second_term in eq .
