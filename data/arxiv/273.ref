( 11 ) into eq . ( 14 ) only the first terms of the γ u , d matrices , wich are proportional to the quark_mass_matrices mu , d , are diagonalized . meanwhile , the second terms will induce non - diagonal interactions_mediated by these scalars . • secondly , the origin of these second terms in eqs . ( 15 ) - ( 18 ) are related to the fact that the three left handed_quark generations do_not transform in the same_way and it is precisely for this particularity those scalars may mediate fcnc_processes [ 22 , 25 ] . these second terms are all suppressed by the scale of symmetry_breaking of the model , v χ . in particular , the second terms in eqs . ( 15 ) - ( 16 ) which refer to sm_higgs mediated processes , are extremely suppressed once we are taking the limit sin β → 0 and v χ UNK v ρ . once we have discussed the physical effects of eq . ( 14 ) , we will write_down the terms that induce fcnc after_applying the transformations given in eq . ( 11 ) as_discussed_above . where , h0 1 lfcncBR, as mentioned in fortney ( 2012 ) and nissen ( 2013 ) , required when directly comparing c / o ratios derived_from different groups . we now focus_on the c / o ratios in each studied system to investigate possible links_between host_star c / o ratios with planetary and system properties . 4 . 2 . trends with c / ohost star versus planetary parameters presently there are two major observed trends relating stellar chemical_composition to the presence of planets – hot_jupiter exoplanets are more often found around intrinsically highermetallicity stars ( e . g . , fischer_&_valenti 2005 ) , and the fraction of stars with giant_planets increases with stellar_mass ( e . g . , johnson et_al . 2010 ; ghezzi et_al . 2010 ; gaidos_et_al . 2013 ) . measuring potential host_stars ’ chemical_abundance distributions may develop into a powerful_tool for inferring the presence , or even specific type ( size , orbit , composition ) , of exoplanets around different_types of stars . this technique is of increasing importance in the context of large surveys that are discovering exoplanets , and targeted studies of unusual or potentially - habitable_exoplanets . in this study we explore_whether the stellar c / o ratio has predictive_power with_respect_to hot_jupiter properties , particularly the exoplanetary atmosphere compositions . characteristic observations of the atmospheres of the exoplanets in this sample – the spitzer / irac 3 . 6 , 4 . 5 , 5 . , and 8 . 0 µ m secondary_eclipse fluxes – as_well as their physical_properties like mass , radius , semimajor orbital axis , period , and equlibrium temperature were_gathered from the nasa_exoplanet archive8 and compared to host_star c / o ratios . by eye itBRthe required exponential term can_be factorized exactly : exp ( − ε t ) = exp ( − ε = exp ( − ε 2 ( π 2 2 fx ( ξ ) π 2 x + π 2 x ) exp ( − ε y + π 2 z ) ) 2 fy ( ξ ) π 2 y ) exp ( − ε 2 fx ( ξ ) π 2 x ) exp ( − ε 2 π 2 z ) , ( 5 ) where π x , π y and π z are the x - , y - and z - components of π , respectively , and the coefficients fx and fy are fx ( ξ ) = cosh ( ξ ) − 1 ξ sinh ( ξ ) and fy ( ξ ) = sinh ( ξ ) ξ , ( 6 ) given as a function of ξ =  b . the next_step is choosing the gauge of the vector potential in a way that each of term in factorization ( 5 ) can_be implemented_efficiently . the linear gauge a = ( − by , 0 , 0 ) , where b is the magnetic_field_strength , is a good choice , because then the components of π are simply π x = kx − by , π y = ky , in terms of the wave_vector k = ( kx , ky , kz ) . this means that π z = kz , the factorized exp ( − ε t ) can_be applied to a wave_function by first fourier_transforming from the ( x , y , z ) basis to ( kx , y , kz ) , where both exp ( − ε z ) andBRpour_ce_faire , il_nous_suffit de_prouver la_proposition_suivante . α i1i3 bi1 ⊗ bi3 , α i1i3 ∈ c , alors . sont_respectivement des_bases de cn3 × n1 n1n3 n1n3 , ( bi3 ) 1 ≤ i3 ≤ n1n3 xi3 = 1 xi1 = 1 xi3 = 1 α i1i3 bi1 ⊗ in2 ⊗ bi3 . n1n3 un1 ⊗ n2 ⊗ n3 ( σ ) = n1n3 xi1 = 1 preuve . soient b1 ∈ cn1 × 1 , b3 ∈ cn3 × 1 . d é veloppons d_’_abord la relation un1 ⊗ n3 · ( b1 ⊗ b3 ) = b3 ⊗ b1 n1n3 n1n3 xi3 = 1 xi1 = 1 xi3 = 1 xi1 = 1 n1n3 n1n3 α i1i3 ( bi1 ⊗ bi3 ) .
