( 2 ) . moreover , the heat_diffusion both within the electronic system and from electrons to the lattice are modified by the gate_voltage via the energy dependence of τ e and τ i , which , in turn , affects the temperature_profile and , thus , indirectly uy . for determining the temperature_profile in the most_general case , we extend the derivation presented in ref . 30 by allowing for an_arbitrary y - dependence of the potential profile . this extension becomes relevant , e . g . , when the changes in the potential profile at the edges of the modulation channels are not sharp but smeared on a scale comparable to the energy diffusion length . a . heat - balance_equation to derive the temperature_profile , we identify the processes which change the local heat density in the electronic system . first , heat is generated_by joule_heating j · e ( power per area ) , where j is the charge current per_unit_length in the 2deg and e the electric_field . second , heat is transferred from the electronic system to the lattice , which we treat as a reservoir with fixed temperature t0 . phenomenologically , this processBRadvance the task . the communication between collaborators can best happen in the context of shared artefacts , to help establish common ground and convey artefact - related messages . collaborative authoring tools can provide various_forms of annotations , to support the coordination of the authoring process . annotations on a shared document can help attract_attention of collaborators to specific parts of the document , make the trace of collaborators visible , and allow for verbal discussions for coordination whenever required . cadiz , gupta and grudin [ 3 ] investigated the use of word 2000 web annotations by program managers , developers and testers for developing software specification documents . based_on interviews with ten of the 450 annotators , they identified six factors that influenced the usage of annotations . maintaining the link_between annotations and their corresponding artefacts turned_out to be the most_important reason for the users_who stopped using the system . maintaining awareness of changes , slow pace of communication through annotations , lack of richness , and 2 direct communication communication through artefacts direct communication aided by artefacts communication through artefacts enriched by annotations spectrum of communication in collaborative systems figure 1 spectrum of communication in collaborative systems figure 2 cycle of reuse , adapted from sumner and dawe , 2001 need for different_levels of communication privacy were other influential factors in using word annotations . another telling example of using annotations for coordinating activities is the article development workflow_management in wikipedia . wikipedia contributors , use annotations to determine the tasks that are needed for improving quality of articles . for example , adding “ citation needed ” notes within articles , and adding standard notes on top of the articles , thatBRx , y ) for k = 1 , 2 , 3 , n , m ( y , x ) for k = 1 , 2 , 3 , which would yields two bounds for the quantity eh ( w ) − 1 , 0h . we would then take the minimum of these two bounds . we proceed in this and γ k v g1 , 0 manner when applying bound ( 4 . 1 ) to prove theorem 4 . 12 . before_proving_theorem 4 . 1 , we introduce some notation and preliminary_lemmas . we define the standardised sum s and t by s = 1 √ m mxi = 1 xi and t = 1 √ n yj nxj = 1 and we have that w = st . in our proof we_shall make_use of the sums si = s − 1 √ m xi and tj = t − 1 √ n yj which are independent of xi and yj , respectively . we therefore have the following formulas w − sit = st − sit = w − stj = st − stj = xit ( 4 . 2 ) 1 √ m 1 √ n yjs . in the proof of theorem 4 . 1 we use the following lemma , which can_be found in pickett [ 33 ] , lemma 4 . 3 . lemma 4 . 3 . let x , x1 , . . . , xm be a collection of independent and identically_distributed_random_variables with mean zero and unit_variance . then , esp = o ( 1 ) for all p ≥ 1 . specifically , es4 = es2 = 1 , 1 m 1 m2 [ 15 ( m − 1 ) ( m −BRand minimally contains an ( e1 , . . . , en ) regular sequence of forms , then there_exists a monomial_ideal j UNK s containing xe1 1 , . . . , xen before we prove theorem 3 , we need the following useful theorem on hilbert funcn such that i and j have the same hilbert function . tions under liaison . theorem 4 ( [ 7 ] ) . let i , j be ( homogeneous ) ideals of s such that j ⊆ i . if s / j is an artinian_gorenstein ring , and s : = max_{ t ∈ n : h ( s / j , t ) UNK = 0 } , then h ( s / i , t ) = h ( s / j , t ) − h ( s / ( j : i ) , s − t ) for all 0 ≤ t ≤ s . an application of liaison theory to the egh conjecture 5 UNK equals , . . . , xan + 1 , n n q ∈ γ s + 1 −BRii ) . UNK 3 . 7 . central simple kantor_pairs of type xn . suppose that f is a field and xn is one of the types of an irreducible reduced root system . we begin by recalling some terminology for finite_dimensional central simple_lie_algebras over f . first let gc be a finite_dimensional simple_lie_algebra of type xn over the complex field c , and choose a chevalley_basis b for gc [ h , § 25 ] . then the z - span gz of b is a lie_algebra over z which depends up to isomorphism only on the type xn . so the chevalley algebra gf : = f ⊗ z gz is a lie_algebra over f , and the quotient algebra gf / z ( gf ) is a finite_dimensional central simple_lie_algebra over f [ se , § ii . 10 and § iv . 1 ] . we call a lie_algebra that is isomorphic to gf / z ( gf ) the split central simple_lie_algebra of type xn over f . the split central simple_lie_algebra of type xn is characterized axiomatically in [ se , chap . ii ] as the classical lie_algebra whose root system with_respect_to a classical cartan_subalgebra has cartan_matrix of type xn . if char ( f ) = 0 , split central simple_lie_algebras are precisely the split ( necessarily central )BRπ n a , where n a is the numerical_aperture of the lens and ν is the wavelength of the illumination light . let h , x0 be the fourier_transform of the psf and the signal x0 respectively , for continuous signals we_know that : ν h ( w ) = 0 for w > fc . hence we measure the modulus of the fourier_transform of x0 UNK h rather_than x0 , where UNK denotes the discrete convolution_operation . if we set θ = θ h , where _ UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK n UNK j = 1 θ h x0 [ j ] e − i2 π ( j − 1 ) ( k − 1 ) n ( x0 UNK h ) [ j ] e − i2 π ( j − 1 ) ( k − 1 ) n , UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK n UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK 2 _ : = k ∈ UNK − fc , fc UNK and bk = 0 elsewhere . j = 1 UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK 2 bk = h2 kx02 k equation ( 2 ) becomes ( with some abuse of notation , in re - indexing k between − n 2 and n 2 − 1 ) : ( 3 ) it_follows from equation ( 3 ) , that in addition to the missing phase problem we are facing a superresolution problem since the high_frequency content of the signal is also lost_due to the physical resolution limitBRelementary relations vhiggs = a tan2 ψ = a UNK 1 cos2 ψ − 1 UNK , a ∈ r . the system is superintegrable as consequence of the superintegrability of the corresponding calogero system . this fact , together_with the dihedral_symmetry of the three - body calogero system , suggests strong links_between the superintegrability of the n - body calogero system [ 16 ] and the existence of discrete symmetry groups possibly in connection with the invariance of the calogero n - body hamiltonian under permutations of the particles [ 10 ] . for the interpretation of ( 2 ) 8 as dynamics of one point on a sphere under the potential of equally_spaced hooke centers placed on a great_circle , see [ 2 , 3 ] . future_directions : platonic symmetries as seen above , there is some strong_connection_between discrete_symmetries and higher_order polynomial first integrals of hamiltonian systemsBR, m − ρ vk , m ≤ r < ǫ . letting m →_∞ , we obtain ρ vk − ρ v , m < ǫ . this implies ρ vk < ρ v , m + ǫ ≤ ρ v + ǫ . on the other_hand , ρ vk ≥ ρ vk , m ≥ ρ vk , n = ρ v , n > ρ v − ǫ . this_completes the proof .
