[ wh10 ] ) . in both problems the number of all 1 tested patterns can_be exponential and therefore each rule should_be tested as fast as possible , preferrably in a constant time . the problem is that typically the mined data_sets are very_largeBRin the context of binary sbm to different biological_networks , such as a transcriptional_regulatory_network , a metabolic_network , a cortex network , etc . a bayesian version of the variational_approximation appears in latouche_et_al . [ 2012a ] for binary graphs [ see also latouche , 2010 , for more_details ] and more_recently in aicher et_al . [ 2013 ] for weighted ones . the aim is now to approximate the posterior_distribution p ( z , θ y ) of both the groups and the parameters , given the data , a task realized within the class of factorized distributions . online extensions of the ( frequentist ) variational_approach have_been given in zanghi et_al .BRcorresponds_to our z ∈ xz rather_than x ∈ x . it is the distinction_between xz and the ‘ super - deterministic ’ state space x that allowed_us_to give a consistent formulation of determinism without jeopardizing freedom . as shown above , this eventually enables one to treat the apparatus settings as parameters rather_than as random_variables . 12this is true even if f = f ( a , b , z ) and g = g ( a , b , z ) rather_than f = f ( a , z ) and g = g ( b , z ) . 4 3 bell_’ s ( 1964 ) theorem for spin - one the free will theorem relies_on a variation of the epr - bohm experiment in which c2 is replaced_by c3 ; specifically , photons with the helicity degree of freedom only ( or electrons with spin only ) are replaced_by massive spin - one particles . although such a ‘ free will experiment ’ has_never_been performed ( though it might_be , one day ) , quantum_mechanics gives unambiguous predictions that may be used in lieu of measurement_outcomes . compared to the set - up of the previous_section , the following changes are to be made : • the settings are now given by a = a and b = b , where a = [ ~ a1 , ~ a2 , ~ a3 ] and b = [ ~ b1 , ~ b2 , ~ b3 ] are frames in r3 , that is , orthonormal_bases ( ~ a1 , ~ a2 , ~ a3 ) etc . in which each unit_vector is defined up to aBR, then dim ( s3 / i3 ) = 9 . thus s3pi ( 1 ⊡ qj ) 6 = 0 , for any 1 ≤ i , j ≤ 3 . then λ i , j 6 = tr ( pi ) in the principal graph , there is only one depth 3 point , and it connects with each depth 2 point with one edge . thus tr ( p1 ) = tr ( p2 ) = tr ( p3 ) > 1 , and dim ( pis3pj ) ≤ 2 , ∀ 1 ≤ i , j ≤ 3 . take c = tr ( p1 ) . by lemma 4 . 2 , we have r ( pi ∗ pj ) ≤ 2 , ∀ 1 ≤ i , j ≤ 3 . note_that among the three projections , at_least_one is self contragredient , we assume_that p1 = p ′ δ pk for some 1 ≤ k ≤ 3 . by theorem 4 . 8 , we have k 6 = 1 , otherwise the biprojection generated_by p1 is e + p1 . without_loss of 2 , and tr ( ( p1 ∗ p2 ) p1 ) = tr ( p2 ( p1 ∗ p1 ) ) = c ( c − 1 ) generality , we assume_that k = 2 .BR. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 3 . 2 . 5 upload . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 3 . 2 . 6 runid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .BRadsorption of surfactants and polymers on colloids invariant_under changes of the interaction parameters ( groot and warren , 1997 ) . full_details of the dpd algorithm adapted to the grand_canonical_ensemble , as_well as simulation details such as the integration algorithm , time step , simulation length , etc . , can_be found in [ gama_goicochea , 2007 ] . 3 results let_us_first illustrate the capabilities of the dpd method by presenting the association of a surfactant molecule with a single hase ( rheology modifier ) molecule . the system consists of 60 surfactant_molecules , in addition to the hase molecule , in solution with solvent_molecules . no colloidal_particles were present therefore periodic_boundary_conditions were used in all directions . all molecules positions are chosen at random initially and are allowed to evolve , subjected_to the dpd forces . figure 1 shows the final configuration obtained after equilibrium was reached . fig . 1 . equilibrium configuration of a single linear molecule of a rheologymodifying agent ( hase ) with a surfactant micelle formed at one of its hydrophobic sites . the colors_represent the different chemical characteristics of the molecules ( see gama_goicochea ( 2013 ) to see the exact chemical_composition and dpd mapping ) . the hydrophilic parts of the hase and surfactant_molecules , as_well as the solvent_molecules are omitted for clarity . a . gama_goicochea 152 as suggested by fig . 1 , hase molecules modify the rheology of fluids by promoting the formation of surfactant micelles on specific hydrophobic sites on the hase backbone . self – association , and association_between different hase molecules can then be modulated through the judicious_choice of surfactants , which in turn will modify the rheology ofBRillegal human intrusion , fire and many other unexpected incidents can occur . so remote_monitoring is a must needed service for these rooms . an intelligent alarm system can_easily assist in this phenomenon by studying all the factors of keeping the room safe from the unexpected situations . the system should_be such that it can monitor room_temperature all the time and generates alarm when the temperature goes above the set temperature as the ambient_temperature requirement is - 5c ~ + 45c and is recommended to be always kept between 15c ~ 30c [ 2 ] . it also can detect if any kind of smoke , hence a fire event_occurs in the room and ultimately generates an alarm . system is also equipped_with sensors which can detect any kind water seepage in the room . any kind of human intrusion through the door can also be easily tracked by this system . so in this project an intelligent alarm system is developed with 8 - bit 40 pin pic microcontroller ic 16f877a and combination of some sensors which generates alarms for any unexpected intrusions and sends the alarms to the network_management centre ( nmc ) [ 3 ] which is under operation and support subsystem ( oss ) [ 4 ] through an alarm box positioned in bts room . 2 . projected system proposed system is built with a main controller that is pic microcontroller 16f877a and some combination of sensors . this alarm system is designed such that illegal human intrusion can_be detected , water seepage be monitored , smoke / fire alarm can_be generated and room_temperature can_be monitored via different sensors . figure 1 . proposed system . 3 . hardware_design 3 . 1 . control module the control moduleBR- triple -
