make a protein , these amino_acids are joined_together in a polypeptide_chain through the formation of a peptide_bond . the structure , function and general properties of a protein are all determined_by the sequence of amino_acids that makes up the primary sequence . the primary structure of a protein is the linear sequence of its amino_acid structural units and it is a part of whole protein_structure . the two torsion_angles of the polypeptide_chain , also called ramachandran angles , describe the rotations of the polypeptide backbone around the bonds between n – c α ( called phi angle , φ ) and c α – c ( called psi angle , ψ ) . torsion angle is one of the most_important parameter of protein_structure and controls the protein_folding . for each type of the secondary_structure elements there is a characteristic range of torsion angle values , which can clearly be_seen on the ramachnadran plot [ 2 ] . figure 1 : sse - in of 1dtp protein . green edges are to be predicted by ant_colony_algorithm another_important property ofBRthe integral term i is “ smoother ” than the free propagator eit ∆ u0 by half a derivative . this is the key point needed in the proof of theorem 3 . 4 for in the special_case wherein the nonlinearity upu is smooth , so when n ≥ 2 . p = 2k , k an_integer , proposition 4 . 3 will show that the duhamel term is almost one derivative smoother_than one_would_expect . remark 4 . 2 . the fact that the nonlinear integral term in duhamel_’_s_formula is smoother_than the linear one in certain_circumstances has_been_used in other works on nonlinear_dispersive_equations . for example , in [ 30 ] it was employed to give a different proof of some of the results obtained in [ 8 ] . in [ 11 ] , this smoothing_effect was applied to deduce global well - posedness below the regularity index provided by the conservation_laws of mass and energy . so_far as we are aware , however , the result stated in proposition 4 . 1 has not_previously_been explicitly_written_down . proof . the details are provided for the case p = 2k , k ∈ n . it will be clear that the arguments extend to the case where p ≥ 1 is not an even integer , but p ≥ ⌊ n 2 ⌋ and n ≥ 2 . dispersive_blow_up for nls 13 step 1 . in the first_step , useful estimates on eit ∆ u0 are derived . start by fixing a j ∈ { 1 , . . . , n } and noticing_that ( 4 . 1 ) x1 . . . xj −BRany v ∈ v1 ; ⋆ y1v = 1w ⋆ the map yv is ” differentiable ” at any v ∈ v1 . namely for any ∆ j ∈ vj : yv ∆ j y − 1 vj + 1 ⊳ vj , this condition can_be written in the form y − 1 then , using the second condition , we_get that the map yv is ” close ” to identity : for ∆ ∈ v1 , y ∆ ∆ − 1 ∈ v2 . ) j ∈ vj + 1 . by the normality , j yv ∆ j ∈ vj + 1 .
