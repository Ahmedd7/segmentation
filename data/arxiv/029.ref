( 2012 ) , where fir 4 appears as a point source , the irs_spectrum is about a factor of 1 . 3 - 1 . 9 too_high ( the range considers the calibration_uncertainty of the 37 . 1 µ m flux ) , roughly_consistent withBRthe correct choice of these parameters . while the standard parameters might suffice for the standard galprop runs a significant_change in the configuration might_lead to the necessity to come_up with a corresponding new set of integration parameters . to investigate the steady_state solution that has_been_found galprop offers some diagnostic_tools . these , however , have explicitly to be administered and also interpreted by the user . therefore , when finding new time - integration parameters , several simulations will have to be done with different parameters until it is certain that a steady_state is reached from a comparison of the results . most of these_issues arise_from the fact that a time integration scheme is used where a steady_state solution is searched forBRfrom the ferromagnet to the non - magnetic material , an opposite reaction must_exist according_to newton_’_s third_law in a broad sense , especially in pt / fm bilayers or multilayers . however , most studies are focused_on features correlated to static magnetic_properties , for example the high perpendicular_magnetic_anisotropy [ 8 – 17 ] , while few reports mentioned the magnetotransport_properties so_far , e . g . the enhanced anisotropic_magnetoresistance in these systems [ 18 – 21 ] . the relevant research on this issue is seriously deficient . we thus employ the anomalous_hall_effect ( ahe ) to investigate the influence of spin obit coupling at interfaces between co2feal ( cfa ) , permalloy ( py , fe22ni78 ) and pt layers systematically , because it is well_known that ahe is strongly_dependent_on the intensity of spin_orbit_coupling in a magnetic object [ 22 – 27 ] . besides , co2feal is a magnetic heusler_alloy with distinguished features . the tunneling_magnetoresistance ( tmr ) ratio of magnetic_tunnel_junction with co2feal electrodes can_be over 330 % at_room_temperature [ 28 ] . dc pulse current - induced_domain_wall_motion has_been_realized in pt / cfa submicron wires with an ultrathin co2feal layer , which displays a similar performance to pt / ( co / ni ) n multilayers [ 29 ]BR58 n > 2 . 5 ∆ n / ninput × 10 − 2 ∆ ( b / a ) / ( b / ainput ) × 10 − 2 ∆ m × 10 − 2 ∆ re / re , input × 10 − 2 ∆ n / ninput × 10 − 2 ∆ ( b / a ) / ( b / ainput ) × 10 − 2 0 . 18 ± 1 . 08 - 0 . 10 ± 1 . 32 1 . 00 ± 3 . 26 0 . 20 ± 7 . 56 - 1 . 44 ± 14 . 47 - 1 . 30 ± 25 . 99 - 18 . 81 ± 42 . 05 26 . 97 ± 100 . 28 - 0 . 02 ± 0 . 42 - 0 . 12 ± 0 . 57 - 0 . 28 ± 0 . 89 - 0 . 87 ± 4 . 29 - 1 . 77 ± 5 . 99 - 1 . 88 ± 11 . 60 - 7 . 14 ± 34 . 10 - 33 . 37 ± 18 . 48 - 0 . 42 ± 1 . 06 - 0 . 54 ± 3 . 08 - 0 . 06 ± 5 . 51 1 . 34 ± 9 . 47 3 . 75 ± 16 . 18 5 . 41 ± 28 . 61 10 . 21 ± 50 . 00 27 . 7 ± 43 . 22 0 . 09 ± 1 . 61 1 . 16 ± 6 . 90 1 . 03 ± 10 . 29 - 0 . 71 ± 14 . 15 - 6 . 18 ± 28 . 62 - 14 . 65 ± 34 . 04BR. 1 ) 9 10 candidate number fig . 1 . results of multiple persistent_current measurements ( in units of the dirac charge ) for the 10 samples which yielded large ( > 0 . 25 gd ) values for the first measurement . ii . experimental procedure the moedal mmt is an aluminium volume placed in the vicinity of the lhcb interaction point . the choice of material is driven by several factors : aluminium is cheap , non - magnetic , and has a nucleus which does_not activate and which , thanks to its large spin , would_be expected to strongly bind with monopoles which would range out and stop within the array [ 25 ] . an initial mmt test array comprising 11 boxes each containing 18 rods of 60 cm length and 2 . 54 cm diameter was_installedBRdependent shell framework . as in ruiter_et_al .

( 7 ) in experiment , the slope b depends slightly on t at the given energy s . e . g . , at the lhc , its value changes by about 10 % within the cone for ∆ t ≈ 0 . 3 gev2 . we neglect it in a first approximation . the normalization_factor in eq .
