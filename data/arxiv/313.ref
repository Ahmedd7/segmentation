UNK electrons UNK sec # electrons = ial qe ( 2 ) ial is the drain_current measured from the aluminum sample , and qe is the charge of an electron . the quantum efficiency is the ratio of number of electrons_emitted to number of incident_photons , as seen in equation 3 . qe = # electrons f lux ( 3 ) equation 3 was used to calculate the quantum efficiency for figure 4 . all results were normalized to the storage_ring beam current . results the quantum efficiency as a function of energy was_found to be strongly_dependent_on the energy of the incident_photon beam . as an example , the quantum efficiency of the al chamber with a photon beam atBR12 ) ( 13 ) and the sign of the pole is chosen such that its imaginary_part is always positive . here we have introduced the dimensionless k - space vectors ka = 2 ky . numerical √ 3a 2 kx and kz = a variable range of the rkky_interaction in edged_graphene 7 integration gives the gf exactly , but we can also use the stationary phase approximation ( spa ) to find an approximate analytic form of the gf , and we do_so later in this_paper . the fact that we have formed the semi - infinite gf by considering combinations of bulk eigenstates makes it natural to see whether the semi - infinite gf can_be written in terms of its bulk counterparts . it_turns_out_that this is both possible to do , and provides geometric insight_into its meaning . 2 . 2 . the image method as_previously_mentioned , the iec in bulk graphene has_been_extensively_studied and most of its features are well_understood . therefore , our strategy is to express the semi - infinite system representing a single - edged_graphene sheet in terms of its bulk counterpart so that we can infer the iec behavior in the presence of edges . such a strategy requires that we relate the semi - infinite gf to that of bulk graphene . in order to express the semi - infinite gf in terms of the more_familiar bulk gfs we expand out the eigenstates in eq . ( 10 ) in terms of their bulk equivalents of eq . ( 9 ) . collecting all the positive ky terms ( ( kx , ky ) , ± i ) leads to the general formula forBRt for any finite t . in fact , note first that at each time t = 1 / q , the next frozen particle ( or root ) becoming active is uniformly_distributed_among all the roots , and the time σ when it “ wakes_up ” is such that the variable v : = 1 / σ ¯ w + 1 / σ ( 3 . 47 ) has the law of the maximum of m independent uniform variables on [ 0 , q / ( ¯ w + q ) ) , with m being the number of roots at time t . since , for all v < q / ( ¯ w + q ) , UNK UNK m UNK v ( ¯ w + q ) UNK m p ( v < v ) = v q / ( ¯ w + q ) = q , ( 3 . 48 ) v has theBRcolumns for a ⊆ [ n ] . definition 2 ( separability_assumption ) . all the data points in x are covered in a finitely_generated and pointed_cone whose generators are a subset a ⊆ [ n ] of data points . that is , ∃ a ⊆ [ n ] s . t . ∀ i ∈ [ n ] , xi ∈ cone ( xa ) , xa = { xi } i ∈ a . an equivalent algebraic form is x = f xa , π f = matrix , f UNK ∈ r ( n − k ) × k the above algebraic form gives_rise_to an nmf model x = f xa . the cone cone ( xa ) is finitely_generated because all the elements in x are conical combinations of a finite setBRof gravity . for d = 1 the constraint arises_from direct tests of the gravitational inverse_square law [ 6 ] . for d = 2 − 6 the limits originate_from constraints on the minimum value of the extra dimensional planck_scale m ∗ [ 7 ] . that we now have a whole ( infinite ) tower of massive hidden_photon fields with masses , 2 m2 γ UNK = n2 r2 ( 1 + o ( χ 2 ) ) , ( 3 ) patras_2013 where n is the kk mode number . each of these interacts_with the ordinary photon via the same kinetic_mixing χ . from the above we can see that we have observable massive hidden_photons without the need to rely_on an_additional higgs or stueckelberg_mechanism . 3 experimental and observational_constraints for the simple 4 - dimensional case a significant number of constraints already exists and have_been_discussed in the literature [ 4 ] ( and references_therein ) . here , we will re - apply the same techniques to the case at_hand . we will_focus on three_types of limits , stellar energy_loss , fixed targetBRparticular , the degree priority principle ensures_that almost_all communities are strong , and the infection_priority_tree principle ensures_that any path of infected strong communities has length o ( log n ) . therefore linear networks from model s are provably_secure . in the proofs of the security result , the community_structures play_an_essential_role in security of networks . however it is not the case that every network with a community_structure is more secure . 2 - dimensional security model we generalize the security model to 2 dimensions such that the networks are rich in overlapping_communities . the 2 - dimensional security model proceeds as follows : given a homophyly exponent a and a natural number d , ( 1 ) let gd be an initial d - regular_graph such that each_node has a distinct color and called seed . for each i > d , let gi − 1 be the graph constructed at the end of step i − 1 , and pi = 1 / ( log i ) a . ( 2 ) at step i , we create a new node , v say .
