( 8 ) in the experiment , we modulate the effect of the 1 / f noise by_adjusting the timing of the inserted a π - pulse in the control sequence . in this way , we can effectively modulate t ϕ 2 , which is referred as t ϕ eff as in the main_text .

UNK we may weaken the hypothesis that x is smooth , using results of [ 6 , 7 ] . in fact , we need only assume_that x is normal , as we now describe . let t be a complete_discrete_valuation_ring with uniformizer t and let x be a projective normal t - scheme with function field f . let p be a non - empty finite set of closed points of the closed fiber x of x , containing all points where distinct irreducible_components of x intersect . let u be the set of connected_components of the complement of p inBRof order m , the binary dihedral_group dm = hc2m , ki , of order 4m and the three exceptional_groups t = hd2 , ω i of order 24 , where ω = 1 ( 1 + i ) i of order 48 and 2 ( 1 − i + j + k ) , o = ht , 1 √ 2 i = hd2 , 1 2 ( ρ + σ i − j ) i , of order 120 , where ρ = 2 cos UNK π 5 UNK and σ = 2 cos UNK 3 π 5 UNK . 3 . 2 . complexification . we consider c ⊆ h to be the subfield c = r ⊕ r · i . given a finite subgroup g of gl ( hn ) , a choice of complex_structure on h realizes g as a subgroup of gl ( c2n ) ( we consider matrices acting_on the right of hn ) . the standard choice of complex_structure , as used in [ 7 ] is h = c ⊕ cj . however , in order to use the results of [ 12 ] , we choose the complexification h = c ⊕ ck . the procedure g ⊂ gl ( hn ) goes to g ∨ ⊂ gl ( c2n ) is called complexification . noting_that ǫ : = e , complexification is uniquely_defined by 2 π i 8 = 1 + i √ 2 i = i 0 −BRthe optimal orbitals , except under_special_circumstances . to show this , consider the removal of two orbitals . since 4 increase the chance that the newton – raphson procedure_terminates at the global maximum , we run the calculation two times . once starting_from the highest_occupied nos and once from the orbitals generated_by the one - by - one elimination scheme . to generate ci coefficients we used a random number generator and have set the unique ci coefficients to ci1i2i3i4 = ran1 − ran2 ran3 − ran4 , where rani are subsequently generated random_numbers . only using one random number , ci1i2i3i4 = ran1 did_not give sufficient variation in the coefficients to give a good sampling over all possible full ci wave_functions . since the full ci wave_functions are completely random , they are not_necessarily eigenfunctions of a physical hamiltonian with only one - and two - body operators . for each randomly_generated ci wave_function we have calculated nBRy . zhou , t . p . grayson , g . a . barbosa and l . mandel , phys . rev . a 47 , 2293 ( 1993 ) .
