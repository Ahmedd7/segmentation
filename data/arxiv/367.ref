( 2012 ) 4 explore properties of the kronecker_product to avoid naive computation , it still needs to perform eigen - decomposition over the covariance_matrix for each mode , which is infeasible for a large dimension mk . moreover , all the latent_factors are coupled in p ( mu ( 1 ) , . . . , u ( k ) ) so that we can not distribute the computation over many computational units or conduct online_learning . to overcome these limitations , we_propose dintucker that assumes the data are sampled from many , smaller gp models , and the latent_variables for these gp models are coupled together in a hierarchical_bayesian_model . the local gp enables fast computation over subarrays and the hierarchical_bayesian_model allows information_sharing across differentBRin the limit β → 0 one_recovers the potential with a purely radiatively lifted flat direction . the ncki potential therefore encompasses a rather_large variety of models , in particular supersymmetric f - term inflation . the spectral_index , which is represented in fig . 7 , takes_values lower_than unity at large fields and close φ = 0 . for modes exiting the hubble_radius_during the transition between these two regimes , the power_spectrum is blue . there_exist two_ways for inflation to stop in the ncki model : i ) the field trajectory reaches the critical_point φ c where the potential develops the waterfall instability , which we will assume to be instantaneous , ii ) the slow - roll_conditions are violated . for the second case , we take  2 = 1 as the condition to identify when the end of inflation occurs . this is well_approximated_by the time when φ reaches the value √ φ end = 2 α .
