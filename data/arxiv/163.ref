on mse happened in 2000 , when ministry of finance issued t - bonds as compensation for “ frozen ” ( old ) foreign - exchange deposits in macedonian commercial_banks before the republic of macedonia gained independence from former yugoslavia ( code : rm01 ) . new types of t - bonds ( bonds for denationalization , code : rmden ) were issued on mse in 2002 . starting_from 2006 , mse regularly calculates bond_price index ( omb ) . mse ’_s short - history strongly_affects securities valuation , due_to the relatively_short time_series and impossibility to calculate market premium . the limited numbers of securities that are quoted and traded on mse as_well as the low liquidity of the market are additional factors that have significant_influence on the process of valuation . the old foreign - exchange saving bonds and bonds for denationalization are_listed and traded on mse . bonds for denationalization are most liquid , permanently and in significant_amounts traded on mse . these types of bonds are the focus of our research . pursuant to the lawBRin the metastable regime of the low_temperature phase , however it appears that tp = tc to within our simulation errors . for d = 4 , no sign of percolation below_tc was observed . discussion we have studied various high dimensional toric_codes , finding that percolation of thermallyactivated defects tp occurs below the phase_transition temperature tc in some cases . contrary to the conventional understanding that percolating defects destroy the topological information at tp , we explicitly demonstrate 4 fig . 3 : onset of percolation in d = 6 . from the crossing of a linear fit to the l = 8 data with the axis , we estimate tp = 3 . 63 ( blue_arrow on t - axis ) . inset : tc = 3 . 80 ( red_arrow on t - axis of main plot ) from the crossing of the upper and lower branches of the free_energy . fig . 4 : transition_temperatures versus dimension . the shaded_region_represents a typical region of hysteresis in tc . that self - correction can occur for t well above tp , where percolating defects exist . further , monte_carlo_simulations of thermal spin_flip processes discover a very_large region of first - order hysteresis near tc . that is , the low_temperature phase is stable on numerically accessible time_scales well above the true tc . this allows for the possibility that the selfcorrecting phase may survive for t well above tcBRhad_been improved by annealing for 30 min at 1015 ° c and then the hydrogen flow was reduced to 10 sccm and 70 sccm of methane were_introduced at an overall pressure of ~ 2 mbar for 15 min . then the furnace_was cooled with a rate of ~ 250_° c / min to ~ 250_° c and the gas flow was stopped . since graphene grows on_both_sides of the copper_foil , the film from one side was protected with a layer of poly ( methyl_methacrylate ) ( pmma , ~ 300_nm ; all resist , ar - p 679 . 04 ) and the graphene film on the opposite_side was etched in an oxygen_plasma for 60 s . the graphene_films were transferred from the cu_foils by etching in an_aqueous_solution ( ~ 3 . 5 % ) of ammonium persulfate ( sigma_aldrich , 98 % ) overnight . then the pmma / graphene sandwich was fished out from the etching solution with a piece of silicon_wafer and transferred on water to clean it from the etching solution for ~ 15 min and subsequently transferred_onto the target substrate . finally the pmma was dissolved at_room_temperature in acetone ( p . a . ) overnight . production and transfer of nh2 - cnms nh2 - cnms were_prepared by electron - beam - induced crosslinking of 4 ´ - nitro - 1 , 1 ´ biphenyl - 4 - thiol ( nbpt ;
