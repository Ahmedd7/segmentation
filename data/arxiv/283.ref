the present experiment does_not_allow to separate the clamping loss contribution to dissipation , since the measured values qm ∼ 2 ×_103 are typical of those of al resonators at 4 k . these have internally limited losses based_on the strong_temperature_dependence of qm in al devices below about 1 k [ 3 ] , whereas clamping loss is expected to be nearly temperature - independent . in conclusion , we have_demonstrated a circuit optomechanics experiment where the mechanical_resonator is a nearly free - free membrane . this is obtained by micromanipulation transfer of an aluminum ” stamp ” on top of a measurement platform . this opens_up perspectives for realizing suspended structures having low losses from supporting clamps , and without the need of caring for etching compatibility of a sacrificial_layer . this_work_was_financially_supported and by the academy of finland though its ltq coe grant ( project no . 250280 ) and the projects 120058 , 110058 and 259912 , by the cryohall infrastructure , by the vaisala_foundation , by the european_research_council ( grant_no . fp7240387 ) , and by the eu 7th_framework_programme ( grant_no . 228464 microkelvin ) . ∗ present_address : korea research_institute of standards and science , daejeon_305 - 340 , republic of korea 4 [ 1 ] c . a . regal , j . d . teufel , and k . w . lehnert , nature_physics 4 , 555 (BRphy - 0757876 . bm also wishes to thank the university of oxford and the leverhulme foundation for their generous_support as a visiting_professor in oxford where much of this_work was_done . we have adapted the numerical algorithm originally_developed by c . yeche for ref .
