( 2006 ) could not predict the strong dependence of λ e while this provided evidence that coil – stretch hysteresis allows wi e to be significantly and wi e on concentration observed in experiments . but their dilute - solution model did_not_account for any inter - chain interactions ; with any such model , the width of the hysteresis window depends_solely_on chain length , but is independent of concentration . infinite_dilution , the ratio wic ~ wi σ is proportional to ratioBR. together these have yielded a wealth of astro - physical data that provides a broad foundation from which to study a dynamically_evolved open cluster . ngc_188 also includes a rich population of 20 blue stragglers1 , as shown in fig . 3 . 1 . importantly , because of the age and solar_metallicity of ngc_188 , these blue_stragglers are in fact not blue — they are late - f and early - g stars with effective temperatures_ranging_from 6000 k to 6500 k . the significance of this lies first in permitting the measurement of highly_precise radial_velocities for these blue_stragglers , yielding all of the results to be reported_here , and then more_broadly in placing the interpretation of these blue_stragglers in the context of our rich understanding of the astrophysics of late - type_stars . 3 . 1 . 2 the wiyn open cluster study and radial_velocities the wiyn observatory 3 . 5 - m telescope combines sizable aperture , wide field of view and excellent image_quality . instrumented with a multi - object_spectrograph providing intermediateBRensure the boltzmann - gibbs_distribution for the final steady_state . therefore , path_integral for the general stochastic interpretation is required to see which interpretation agrees_with the dynamical_behavior of the system_under_consideration . previous_attempts on constructing path_integral for the general stochastic interpretation [ 15 – 17 ] ( called the α - interpretation ) are still_controversial . the uniqueness of the action function is claimed [ 15 ] , while the action in [ 16 , 17 ] depends_on the stochastic interpretation . the uniqueness of the action function contradicts to the fokker - planck formulation that different interpretations lead to corresponding different processes [ 18 ] . on the other_hand , when applying the α - interpretation path_integral formula in [ 16 , 17 ] to the geometric_brownian_motion ,BR3 . this already indicates a similar type of blow - up as for gkp i . this is confirmed by an asymptotic_analysis of the norms in fig . 5 . 3 close to the blow - up . as before we fit lnu ∞ for the solution shown in fig . 5 . 1 to ln c1 + c1 ln ( t ∗ − t ) and lnuy2 to ln c2 + c2 ln ( t ∗ − t ) . for the fitting of u ∞ we use the 500 last computed points and get c1 = 1 . 8650 , c1 = − 0 . 1721 and t ∗ = 1 . 3335 ∗ 10 − 3 . 19 00 . 020 . 040 . 060 . 080 . 11234567tuy200 . 020 . 040 . 060 . 080 . 16810121416182022tu UNK fig . 5 . 2 . modulus of the fourier_coefficients of the solution u in figure 5 . 5 at t = 1 . 3163 ∗ 10 − 3 . fig . 5 . 3 . norms of the solution to the gkp i equation ( 1 . 1 ) with n = 3 for the initial_data u0 = 6 ∂ xx exp ( − ( x2 + y2 ) ) ) in dependence of time ; on the left the l ∞ norm of the solution u , on the right the l2_norm of uy . despite the oscillations in u ∞ in fig . 5 . 4 , the value of c1 is close to the expected − 2 / 9 . the fitting is less_convincing for the l2_norm of uy . for the last 200 time_steps we_get c2 = − 4 . 256 , c2 = − 2 . 576BR. g . , mohamed , s . s . , & de_mink , s . e . 2013 , a & a , 552 , a26 abate , c . , pols , o . r . , izzard , r . g . , & karakas , a . i . in prep . aoki , w . , beers , t . c . , christlieb , n . , et_al . 2007 , apj , 655 , 492 busso , m . , gallino , r . , &_wasserburg , g . j . 1999 , ara_& a , 37 , 239 cameron , a . g . w . 1955 , apj , 121 , 144 frebel , a . , christlieb , n . , norris , j . e . , et_al .BR. kamiya , and h . hosono , j . am . chem . soc . 128 , 10012 ( 2006 ) .
