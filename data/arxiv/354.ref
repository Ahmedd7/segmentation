the instances provide more_reliable information_about the bag class . an exception is alt . atheism , where the performance of dmeanmean is quite high . this can also be explained with the plot in fig . 6 . here we see outlying positive instances , all belonging_to different positive bags , similar to the multi - concept dataset . these instances are the most_informative for the bag class , therefore dissimilarities involving these distances can perform well . this is the case for dmeanmin , dmaxmin and dmeanmean , which is reflected in the performances . figure 6 : multi - dimensional scaling projection of instances in the musk 1 ( left ) and alt . atheism ( right ) datasets overall , dmeanmin gives the best results . although it is possible that only a few instances per bag are informative ( as in the concept artificial dataset ) , considering all instances ( and their minimum_distance neighbors ) with equal weight seems to be already be sufficient in practice . 20 instancein + vebaginstancein - vebag instance in + ve baginstance in − ve bag 5 . 2 . distribution dissimilarities table 3 shows the results of theBR0 . 10 23 . 02 ± 0 . 10 21 . 89 ± 0 . 04 21 . 51 ± 0 . 04 20 . 29 ± 0 . 01 19 . 97 ± 0 . 01 19 . 49 ± 0 . 02 19 . 54 ± 0 . 04 a r e a s s e s s m e n t o f p r o p e r t i e s o f l u m i n o u s s m g s 1 9 20 m . p . koprowski et_al . appendix c : comparison of single - dish and interferometic flux_densities and identifications in this appendix we illustrate the extent to which flux_densities and redshifts resulting from the galaxy identification process depend_on_whether one works with the original single_dish ( sub - ) mm fluxes and positions , or instead adopts the corresponding information derived_from the interferometric ( pdbi and sma ) observations . c UNK 2012_ras , mnras_000 , 1 – 23 11 10 id no id wrong id a reassessment of properties of luminous smgs 21 ids based_on single - dish positions a1 a2 . / y j m m m 1 1 f h s d e g n s i l i 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 . / y j m m m 1 1 f h s d e g n s l i i 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2BR= + 0 . 3 ) for axisymmetric tensile_loadings  1 =  2 and  3 /  1 = 2 . 5 corresponding to a fixed triaxiality t  = 1 . the onset of failure corresponds_to the strain at which there is an_abrupt_change in the slope of the  [ ln ( ) ] vs . ee curve ( see interrupted line ) while collapse takes_place when the  = 1 . black_dots_mark the onset of failure . 22 _ _ f  _ 2012c / cc2012c / cc ln [ ( ) ] vs . ee curve reaches a maximum . the critical phase of the deformation process , where accelerated damage_accumulation occurs is highlighted . figure 7 : evolution of the effective load carrying cross - section ( cell cross - section minus the void ) with the macroscopic strain ee for porous_materials with matrix characterized_by different tensile / compression asymmetry ratios : σ t / σ c = 0 . 83 , ( k = - 0 . 3 ) , von_mises_material σ t = σ c = 1 ( same response in tension and compression : k = 0 ) ; σ t / σ cBR. the only difference is that now we require strongprofunctors instead of plain profunctors . ins : : strongprofunctor a ⇒ a q q − → free ⊗ a ins x = comp x ( arr id ) free : : ( strongprofunctor a , arrow b ) ⇒ ( a q q − → b ) → ( free ⊗ a q q − → b ) free f ( hom g ) = arr g free f ( comp x y ) = f x ≫ free f y here , we would really like the type ( a q q − → b ) to represent strength preserving morphisms between strong profunctors . therefore ,BRat an isolated point , it can_be removed by the transmutation procedure of transformation_optics [ 4 , 13 ] at the cost of introducing some anisotropy in the transmuted region . b . cloaking of waves with an isotropic material consider a point charge located_at ( 0 , 0 , z0 ) , outside a zeropermittivity ball of radius b centred_on the origin . the electricfield lines from the charge are guided around the ball in much the same_way as rays are guided around a cloaked_region . guiding of magnetic - field lines around zero - permeability ( superconducting ) objects is more_familiar , but here we_wish to have a point source for the field so we consider an electrostatic example of such field exclusion . using the standard boundary - value methods of electrostatics [ 14 ] , it is straightforward to show that the electric_potential outside the ball is ( for unit charge and with ε 0 = 1 ) UNK φ ( r ) = 1 4 π 1 UNK x2 + y2 + ( z − z0 ) 2 ∞ UNK lb2l + 1 UNK UNK , UNK z r + ( l + 1 ) ( z0r ) l + 1 pl where r = UNK x2 + y2 + z2 . we choose the amplitude r ( r ) r > b , ( 12 ) l = 0 and phase s ( r ) of our wave to be r ( r ) = − φ ( r ) , s ( r ) = − ω 4 π cr ( r ) .
