intuitive result is explained_later by the local field effect ( lfe ) [ 37 ] , i . e . , an asymmetric optical_lattice , due_to asymmetric scattering of the incident optical_beams by the condensate , generates the asymmetric diffraction . currently , most of matter wave diffraction_experiments apply either an_optical_lattice or a magnetic lattice . meanwhile , magneto - optical diffraction of atoms in a magnetic_field by a circularly_polarized optical standing_wave [ 38 ] has_also_been_investigated for static atomic_clouds to achieve a large_momentum_transfer . in this approach , zeeman_splitting of energy_levels in an_external_magnetic_field is used such that the energy difference of the atoms and the considerably induced wavefront curvature could_lead to a systematic phase error in an interferometer based_on the splitter [ 17 ] . in this_paper , we experimentally_demonstrate a magneto - optical atomic diffraction , combining a quadrupole - ioffe - configuration ( quic ) trap and an optical standing_wave , which is not circularly_polarized as in [ 38 ] . we observe an asymmetric atomic diffraction and matter wave self -

( iii ) identification of the set of delaunay tetraheda that enclose a given cavity . ( iv ) computation of the cavity volume and surface_area of the cavity contained in each delaunay tetrahedron . an efficient_way of implementing this algorithm to the free volume calculation without repeated tessellations is described in [ 25 , 26 ] . the free volume distributions , over a wide_range of densities [ 25 , 26 ] , is described well by the form f ( vf ) ∝ v α f exp ( − β v γ f ) ( 2 ) where the parameters α , β and γ are smoothly_varying functions of density yielding a mean free volume thatBRthe same solution . from the definition of the maximum network_lifetime problem ( 2 ) and the property ( 19 ) of the data transmission cost energy matrix e it_follows that the sensors always send their data to the nearest data_collector 1 . j , 2 . i = 0 and q UNK 1 . i , 2 . j = q UNK 1 . i , 1 . j = q UNK m , ( sk n ) ( 1 ) n ) ( 2 ) ∀ pn ∈ sn , pk ∈ ck ∪ c ( x ) , qn , k UNK = 0 ⇒ ∀ pk UNK ∈ ck ∪ c ( x ) d ( pn , pk ) ≤ d ( pn , pk UNK ) . 9 this means that the data_collectors cannot receive any data from senors which lie behind the reflection line xm . these properties are valid for any reflection sm , m ∈ [ 0 , m − 1 ] of dm and from this it_follows that the data is not sent across any reflection line xm , m ∈ [ 0 , m − 1 ] . because of the symmetry , inside each of the 2m regions the solutions of ( 2 ) are identical and can_be represented_by a solution in f0 ∪ c0 ∪ c1 .

[ 2 ] the total graph of a graph g is the graph , denoted_by t ( g ) , is the graph having the property that a one - to one_correspondence can_be defined between its points and the elements ( vertices and edges ) of g such that two points of t ( g ) are adjacent if and only if the corresponding elements of g are adjacent ( either if both elements are edges or if both elements are vertices ) or they are incident ( if one element is an edge and the other is a vertex )
