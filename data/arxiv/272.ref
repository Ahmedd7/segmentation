no . here is why : 6 a . sometimes it is bostrom who is presumptuous we must_be very_careful when analyzingBR31 ) proof : the proof is provided in appendix a . remark 1 : the result in condition 1 is the same as the result in [ 17 ] . for this case , the dimension of the shared signal space decreases as the number of antennas at the relay increases . for this reason , as we will see in the achievable_dof for the mimo multi - way_relay_channel , using only a subset of the antennas at the relay is sufficient . remark 2 : condition 2 implies that , when there is asymmetry between the number of antennas at the users , the dimension of shared signal space between two users cannot_exceed the dimension of the user with the smallest number of antennas . aBR, the mass of the merger_product , or mass_transfer enhanced secondary , must_exceed the current turn - off mass . the merger or mass_transfer event must also have occurred relatively recently , i . e . less_than the blue_straggler lifetime ago . if we assume here that the merger or mass_transfer is driven by the evolution of the primary off the main_sequence , then this is equivalent to requiring that the primary mass subtracted by the current cluster turn - off mass is less_than some amount . for example , if we take a blue_straggler lifetime of one gigayear , and a turn - off mass today of 0 . 8 m UNK , then we require that the primary mass is in the range 0 . 8 m UNK ≤ m1 ≤ 0 . 816 m UNK . we note_that this is a rather_narrow_range of masses ( due_to the very_strong mass dependance of main_sequence lifetimes ) . typically , only a small_fraction of binaries will satisfy this condition . if we consider a binary population where stars are drawn_from a reasonable initial mass function ( imf ; in our case , from [ 11 ] ) , then we find that the fraction of binaries making a blue_straggler seen today would_be fbs UNK 0 . 006 . if the binaries which produce blue_stragglers are allowed to evolve in globular_clusters without_any interactions with other stars , then we would simply expect that the number of blue_stragglers derived_from these primordial_binaries would_be proportional to the cluster mass : nbs , bin ∝ fbs , binmtot ( 9 . 7 ) where fbs , bin is the fraction of the original binary populationBR1 . it_follows that σ > 1 and so w is in h σ + 2 ⊂ h3 . applying theorem a . 3 then yields ( 6 . 5 ) furthermore , by proposition 5 . 2 , UNK w UNK h3 ≤ c UNK lw UNK h1 = UNK u − px u UNK h1 . since the usual norm for h1 is equivalent to the UNK · UNK a norm , we have UNK w UNK h3 ≤ c UNK u − px u UNK a . then , by this inequality and ( 6 . 2 ) , we see that UNK w UNK h3 ≤ c UNK u − ix u UNK h1 . combining this with ( 6 . 5 ) gives_us ( 6 . 4 ) .
