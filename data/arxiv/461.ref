the homomorphism h : s → gf used there factors_through it , which gives the chain of subdata ( gl2 , h ± 1 ) ֒_→ ( gf , x f ) ֒_→ ( gsp2g , h ± g ) . such shimura_curves are called shimura_curves of type i . r note_that the shimura_curves given by different embeddings ( gl2 , h ± 1 ) ֒_→ ( gf , x f ) ֒_→ ( gsp2gBRt ¯ t production ( with at_least_one fake_lepton ) is one of the dominant_backgrounds for this analysis . to mitigate large statistical_uncertainties on the prediction of this background in the muon channel , a per - jet j → µ fake_rate probability is applied to every t ¯ t dimuon event . the fake_rate fj → µ was derived by taking the number of events with a fake muon and dividing that by the number of jets that could fake a muon . to estimate the number of fake_leptons , we assume_that every event in the same - sign ( ss ) dimuon_channel of t ¯ t has a fake_lepton . we further assume_that a fake muon is equally_likely to have positive or negative charge , so we multiply our count of ss dimuon_events by a factor of two to account for the number of fake muons in the opposite_sign ( os ) dimuon_channel . finally , we divide this number by the total_number of jets with minimum pt of 25 gev in the semi - leptonic muon channel of the t ¯ t sample to find the fake_rate as follows : fj → µ = 2 × nss njets in µ + jets = 6 . 5 × 10 − 5BR, it is generally_believed that the measurement - induced_dephasing is caused_by the photon number fluctuations in the cavity , 6 , 9 – 13 ) as it has_been_experimentally_demonstrated . 14 , 15 ) in contrast to this semiclassical photon shot - noise dephasing , here we_propose that measurement - induced_dephasing takes_place even in the vacuum limit of the cavity where the photon number fluctuation is completely_suppressed . to be specific , we consider a qubit coupled to a resonator with a single_photon mode in the dispersive limit . we show that the qubit is dephased due_to the vacuum field in the resonator with the condition that the photon number is always zero in the cavity . this demonstrates a novel property of the vacuum manifested in the context of the quantum_mechanical complementarity . model hamiltonian - a qubit interacting with a singlemode resonator is represented_by the hamiltonian , h = h0 + hc + v0c , ( 1a ) where h0 denotes the qubit + cavity_mode represented_by the usual jaynes - cummings model16 ) with rotating_wave_approximation . hc and v0c represent the continuum modes outside the cavity and the cavity - continuum interaction , respectively : h0 =  ω r a † a + 1 2 ! +  ω q 2 σ z +  g ( a † σ − + σ + a ) , ( 1b ) hc = xk v0c = xk 1  ν k a †_kak + 2 ! ,  α k UNK a † ka + a † ak UNK .
