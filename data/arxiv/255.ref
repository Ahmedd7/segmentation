major_axis , eccentricity , inclination and the frequency analysis corresponding to the orbital_motions of some space_debris are studied . possible irregular motions are observed by the presence of different resonant_angles describing the orbital dynamics of these objects . 2 . resonant objects orbiting the earth in this section , the tle data are used to verify objects in resonant orbital_motions and what resonance has the majority of objects [ 3 ] . the present distribution of objects by the value of the mean motion n indicates the commensurability between the frequencies of the mean motion of the object and the earth_’ s rotation motion . see the histogram of the mean motion in fig . 1 . all data different objects 1000_800_600_400_200 s t c e b o j f o r e b m u n 0 0 2 4 6 8 n ( rev / day ) 10 12 14 16 18 figure 1 : histogram of the mean motion of the cataloged objects . in fig . 1 it is verified that most of the objects are in theBRthe complexity in socio -

scale data on socio - economic_systems may make it possible to understand our society from a holistic point of view . to do_so , we need to discuss the possibilities of comprehensive_analysis and data linkage . in this section , four_types of exemplar studies on socio -

2009 . furthermore , huge earthquakes hit japan on 11 march_2011 , and the japanese economy suffered_from a large number of social losses . so_far , we have explained the affairs by the japan explanatory narrative . the question remains , however , as to how we can describe ourBR. cloudrank1 and cloudrank2 are having same response -
