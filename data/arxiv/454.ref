( generality ) the generic framework allows that , as long as an estimator has an asymptotically linear representation with a model - independent parameter , a composite estimator can then be constructed by a regression combination of several initial estimators according_to different values of this parameter . 2 . ( variance_reduction ) by selecting proper weights , the acr is shown to beBRreproduce the recovery phase , instead of the exponential function . a superposed_epoch analysis of recovery phases of intense storms from 1963 - 2006 was_performed , categorizing the storms by their intensity into five subsets . the hyperbolic decay function reproduces experimental_data better_than what the exponential function does for any subset of storms , which indicates a non - linear coupling_between ddst / dt and dst . moreover , this kind of mathematical function , where the degree of reduction of the dst_index depends_on time , allows for explaining different lifetimes of the physical_mechanisms involved in the recovery phase and provides new_insights for the modeling of the dst_index . 1 . introduction as a result of the solar_wind - magnetosphere coupling , there is energy_transfer into the inner_magnetosphere . plasma_sheet ions were thought for many_years to be energized and trapped on closed drift paths producing a symmetric ring current around the earth . the strength of the ground disturbance produced by the gyration and drift of these ions was quantified by the hourly dst_index [ sugiura and kamei , 1991 ] , calculated by averaging horizontal magnetic deviations observed at four low_latitudes stations . this index was considered as a measure of the ring current intensity reporting on the total energy of ring current particles through the dessler - parker - sckopke ( dsp ) relation [ dessler and parker , 1959 ; sckopke , 1966 ] . looking_at dst_index , the main feature of a geomagnetic_storm is a depression , corresponding to the main phase of the storm , lasting between approximately 3 and 12 hours , which is followed_by a slower recovery during which dst increases back toward zero over hours to tens ofBR( y ) ) . as a conclusion , we have obtained : lemma 3 . 2 . there is a positive_constant c such that for all x , y ∈ m satisfying d ( x , y ) ≥ 1 κ r ( x ) ≤ r ( y ) ≤ κ r ( y ) or when r ( x ) ≥ κ r ( y ) κ r ( x ) and 1 r ( x , y ) ≤ c vol b ( o , r ( x ) ) , and when when r ( y ) ≥ κ r ( x )BRv , k , λ , µ ) - srg . we say that g is ok if either it has no disconnecting set such that each component has as at_least two vertices , or if κ 2 ( g ) = 2k − λ − 2 . let g be a connected_graph . if s is a disconnecting set of g of minimum size such that the components of g \ s are not singletons , then denote by a the vertex set of one of the components of g \ s of minimum size . by our choice of a , b ≥ a , where b : = v ( g ) \ ( a ∪ s ) . as s is a disconnecting set , n ( a ) ⊂ s and consequently , s ≥ n ( a ) . note_that it is possible for the disconnecting set s to contain a vertex y and its neighborhood n ( y ) in which case y ∈ s , but y / ∈ n ( a ) and thus , s 6 = n ( a ) . in order to prove brouwer_’ s conjecture is true for a ( v , k , λ , µ ) - srg g with vertex set v and v ≥ 2k − λ + 3 , we will show that s ≥ 2k − λ − 2 for any subset of vertices a with 3 ≤ a ≤ v 2 havingBRlike hgte , the touching of four bands at the gamma point is protected by cubic symmetries ( the bands at the gamma point belong_to a four - dimensional representation of the cubic group oh ) , and the absence of a linear term follows_from time - reversal and cubic ( inversion ) symmetries . moreover , thanks to inversion and time - reversal_symmetries , all bands are doubly - degenerate away_from the gamma point . the magnetic order parameter field φ transforms as follows under the symmetries of the “ disordered ” system . it is odd under time - reversal_symmetry ( since the spins UNK s → − UNK s under time - reversal ) , and so only the ( timereversal - odd ) γ ab can couple to it . it is even under inversion ( since UNK s → UNK s under inversion ) , unchanged under three - fold rotations , and odd under the allowed reflections of the pyrochlore_lattice . a single gamma matrix , namely γ 45 ∝ jxjyjz + jzjyjx [ 10 , 30 ] ( see below ) , transformsBR) and β = log ( π p / 2 ) / log ( coshp ( π p / 2 ) ) are the best_possible constants . 2 . preliminaries and proofs the following lemmas will be used in the proof of main_result . 2 . 1 . lemma .
