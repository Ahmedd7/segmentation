point where the probabilities no_longer change . the likelihoods of each of the models in a grid are themselves combined to form a likelihood for the whole grid . since properly_normalized priors are used , we can then compute the average of the prior - weighted likelihoods for each grid . this is the overall bayesian_evidence for each grid . in other_words , the evidence represents the overall probability of a given grid but with the probability correctly normalized by the priors so that it can_be directly compared to the probabilities of other grids . in our analysis we assume_that evidence ratios ( called odds_ratios ) greater_than a factor of 10 , deemed “ very_strong ” by jeffreys ( 1961 ) , represent a significant_difference . our bayesian_analysis is restricted to testing only the hypothesis put_forward . it cannot , unless specific tests are created , be used to determine the underlying physical causes and effects of the various_scenarios investigated . therefore , to more fully understand_how adjustments to each parameter affect our models of procyon we have guenther_et_al . modeling_procyon 18 computed models that fit procyon ’_s observed mass and hr_diagram location but which have a single parameter varied ( section 5 ) . in this way we can_easily see how each of the parameters directly_affect the structure and p - mode_frequencies of the models . 3 . diffusion as noted in the introduction ( section 1 . 4 ) , the diffusion rates of metals and helium in procyon are predicted to be very_high (BR7 % 13 % 2 ) battery energy_consumption . : we record the battery current and voltage every 1 second and conduct each trial for one_hour . note_that all the data is obtained from one same device because the energy_consumption varies from one device to another . to compare the energy_consumption among different devices is meaningless and may be misleading . for comparison , we also test the energy_consumption of wifi under similar communication tasks . 1 : bt off 2 : bt on 3 : s 100b / 1s at 1 link 4 : s 100b / 0 . 1s at 1 link 5 : s 100b / 10ks at 1 link 6 : s 1000b / 1s at 1 link 7 : s 5000b / 1s at 1 link 8 : s 100b / 1s at 3 links ( simu . ) 9 : s 100b / 1s at 3BRq0 = ( 1 , p ) , q ′ / q ′ 0 = ( 1 , p ′ ) . the solid_angle d ω κ ′ is associated_with the vector κ ′ , while the integral is restricted to the phase_space for which p = p ′ + k + k ′ . a typical baseline distance for atmospheric_neutrinos is on the order of 1000_km . neutrinos with significant superluminal speeds would dissipate much of their energy via cerenkov pair_production before being detected , so the observation of high - energy neutrinos implies a limit on the rate of energy_loss . the characteristic propagation_distance associated_with this energy_loss is given by the distortion distance d ( e ) = − e / ( de / dx ) . numerically performing the integral in eq . ( 4 ) , we can determine d ( e ) for various fixed values of each coefficient c ( d ) in turn . large negative values of c ( d ) produce a distortion distance much_smaller_than 1000_km , which would_imply a substantial energy_loss . identifying the value of c ( d ) for which d ( e ) ≃ 1000_km therefore gives an estimated lower constraint on c ( d ) . the third_column of table i lists the bounds obtained in this manner for d = 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , assuming an atmospheric origin for the pev icecube_events .BRp ∈ c , we decide if p can_be prevented from winning in polynomial time by partitioning voters . let v ′ contain the voter set of the election , but with all of the manipulators ’ votes set to only approve of p . since we are in the ties - promote case , it would not benefit the manipulators to approve of any candidates in addition to p . the chair then follows the polynomial time algorithm described in [ hhr07 ] to determine if control is possible . theorem b . 35 approval - dcpv - tp - mf is in p . proof . given an election e = ( c , v ) , where the voter set contains k manipulators , and a despised_candidate p ∈ c , we decide if p can_be prevented from winning in polynomial time by partitioning voters . all of the manipulators approve of only p . since the manipulators want p to be a winner and we are in the ties - promote case , it does_not benefit the manipulators to approve of candidates other_than p because this may_cause rival candidates of p to be promoted to the run - off . the chair then follows the polynomial time algorithm described in [ hhr07 ] to determine if control is possible . c plurality c . 1 collaborative : theorem c . 1 plurality - m + ccav is in p . proof . given an election e = ( c , v ) , a set of unregistered_voters ( where the sets of unregistered and registered_voters contain manipulators ) , an add limit , and a preferred_candidate p ∈ c , we decideBRand arrow ’_s conditions : existence and correspondence theorems for voting_procedures and social_welfare functions , journal of economic_theory 10 ( 1975 ) , no . 2 , 187_– 217 . emily shen , pattern_matching encryption , strategic equivalence of range voting and approval_voting , and statistical robustness of voting_rules , ph . d . thesis , massachusetts_institute of technology , 2013 .
