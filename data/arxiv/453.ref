value function using a linear function_approximator . we use a feature_extractor φ : st × at → { 0 , 1 } n , n ∈ n , built on tile coding [ 21 ] to generate feature_vectors from state variables and actions . this is a sparse vector with a constant number of “ 1 ” features , hence , a constant norm . in addition , tile coding has the key_advantage of real - time learning and to implement computationally_efficient_algorithms to learn approximate value functions . in linear function approximation , there_exists a weight vector , θ ∈ rn , n ∈ n , to 7 be learned . therefore , the approximate gvfs are defined as : q ( s , a , θ ) = θ t φ ( s , a ) , such that , q : s × a × rn → r . weights are learned using the gradientdescent temporal - difference algorithm ( 1 ) [ 7 ] . the algorithm learns stably and efficiently using linear function approximation from off - policy experiences . offpolicy experiences are generated from a behavior policy , π b , that is different from the policy being learned_about named as target policy , π . therefore , one could learn multiple target policies from theBRporous_media , elsevier , new_york , 1972 . 2 . i . bushuyev , global_uniqueness for inverse parabolic_problems with final observation , inverse_problems , 11 ( 1995 ) , l11 -
