( 24 ) each binary variable si = ± 1 has a bernoulli prior p ( sia ) = a whether the coefficient wi is included in the model . the prior for wi , conditioned_on si , is ( 1 − a ) ( 1 − si ) ( 1 + si ) 2 2 and determines p ( wisi , τ 2 ) = 2 π τ 2 e − w2 i 2 τ 2 for si = + 1 , for si = − 1 i = 1 d UNK ____ 1 √ δ ( wi ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) ( 27 ) + w + τ − 2 δBRoption is to coarsen the least informative bins . since most of the unobserved variants are rare , we do_not_care for the precise frequency of the common variants . we use a bin - merging strategy , collapsing bins containing common variants into a smaller set of coarser bins . this has the added_benefit of reducing the number of constraints , making the problem numerically more_tractable . we use a simple scheme in which we keep the p lowest - frequency bins intact , then merge the next two bins , then the following four bins , and so on , increasing the bin_size exponentially until all bins have_been_taken_into_account . we then choose p as high as possible without_making the lp problem infeasible . fortunately , figure s2 shows that it is not necessary to use a large number of bins to obtain tight_bounds . this procedure will result in a predicted range for the number of discovered polymorphisms . this range accounts_for uncertainties about the underlying distribution , but not for sampling uncertainty . to account for sampling uncertainty , we can bootstrap the data , each bootstrap iteration providing a confidence_interval . we can then define confidence_intervals by using 95_%_confidence_intervals on both the upper and lower_bounds . such confidence_intervals on bounds are expected to be more_conservative than confidence_intervals on point estimates . multiple_populations the strategies described_above do_not_require random_mating assumptions . they can therefore predict the number of variants in samples_drawn from multiple_populations if subsamples from the subpopulations are available . the lp approach can_be generalized to bound any linear function of the joint sfs , including the number ofBRx log x , x ≥ k ( > 1 ) for some k large_enough , σ and b may not satisfy the lipschitz_condition , so the method of moments used in the literature ( such as [ 6 , 7 , 16 ] ) does_not work here because of the non - lipschitz feature of coefficients . x , x ≤ 1 we now give an example to show that our conditions are really weaker_than_those relevant conditions existing in the literature . example 1 . 1 we just consider the time - homogeneous case for simplicity . suppose d = 2 , m = 1 . for any r > 0 , define σ ( x )BR17 , 4269 ( 2000 ) [ erratum - ibid . 21 , 5017 ( 2004 ) ] [ arxiv_: hep - th / 0006179 ] .
