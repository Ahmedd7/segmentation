( 3 ) since variance supplies the scale for the statistics , we fix the scale as v2 β = σ 2 β − 1 [ 44 ] . with out loss of generality we consider t ≥ n . we use the binary correlation method in order to obtain the ensemble - averaged spectral_density , ρ w ( λ ) . in this method it is convenient to deal_with the stieltjes_transform or the resolvent of the density while the resolvent , gw ( z ) , is defined as gw ( z ) = h ( z1n − w ) − 1 in , ( 4 ) where z = λ ± i ǫ for positive infinitesimal ǫ and the angular_brackets stand for the spectral averaging , e . g . 2 hhik = k − 1 tr h for k × k dimensional h . then ρ w ( λ ) can_be determined via the relation ρ w ( λ ) = lim ǫ → 0 ∓ π ℑ gw ( z ) . ( 5 ) in order to calculate gw ( z ) we use the moment expansion : gw ( z ) = mn zn + 1 , ∞ xn = 0 where mn is the n ’ th moment of ρ w ( λ ) defined as ( 6 ) ( 7 ) mn = z d λ λ n ρ w ( λ ) = hwnin . in principle , the problem is solved onceBRsparse_coding on recognition_accuracy ( shown as percentage ) . data set : caltech - 101 ; number of training_images per class : 30 caltech - 256 spm - sc deepsc - 2 deepsc - 3 k = 1024 43 . 04 ± 0 . 34 46 . 02 ± 0 . 57 47 . 0 ± 0 . 45 k = 2048 45 . 66 ± 0 . 53 48 . 04 ± 0 . 44 48 . 85 ± 0 . 42 k = 4096 47 . 8 ± 0 . 63 49 . 29 ± 0 . 50 49 . 91 ± 0 . 39 table 3 : effect of dictionary size used in sparse_coding on recognition_accuracy ( shown as percentage ) . data set : caltech - 256 ; number of training_images per class : 60 7 15 - scene spm - sc deepsc - 2 deepsc - 3 k = 1024 80 . 83BRψ ± 0 + d0 ) UNK UNK ψ ± d0 UNK UNK ψ odd 0 UNK = ( c1 − c † 0 UNK = ( cn + c † UNK = 0 , d † 1 ) UNK UNK ψ ± 0 UNK = ± UNK UNK ψ ∓ 0 UNK , 0 UNK = ± UNK UNK ψ ± n ) UNK UNK ψ ± 0 UNK , 0 UNK UNK ψ odd UNK = ψ even the only physical difference_between UNK UNK ψ odd i is the occupation of the majorana - zero mode , which can_easily be altered by creation and annihilation of fermions at the boundaries . these two ground_states differ in their fermion_parity , which is only a global , but not a local property .

gassing rate is dependent on the interior surface_area , temperature and also the volatility of the substances used in the fabrication of the different components . figure 1 depicts a sample spectrum highlighting the performance features of the mass analyzer in the laboratory . instrument characterization has_been_carried_out extensively at_elevated_temperatures ( 150 c ) wherein both the vacuum system and also the mass analyzer were baked thoroughly for several_hours under ultra_high vacuum conditions . the dominant atmospheric species like n2 and o2 are clearly_seen in the lab spectrum . the presence of 40ar is 6 quite conspicuous and as expected forms ~ 1 % of the total concentration . the total absence of 36ar and 38ar , which are the other two stable_isotopes is worth_noting . though the background spectra could_be characterised with reasonable certainty , since the out gassing can never be totally eliminated , any measurement of an unknown ambience needs to be necessarily carried_out in the back drop of some of these constituents . on the other_hand , when measurements pertain to deep space which could_be construed_as an open system with infinite pumping capacity ,BR·_·_· , kr − 1 } . it is easy to find that all ki satisfy x r = 1 . = 1 , there is a unique j1 ∈ { 0 , 1 , ·_·_· , r − 1 } such that UNK δ r α − 1 UNK rt − 2 = kr − j1 UNK δ r α − 1 UNK rt − 2 ( ρ s ) j1 · rt − 1 = 1 likewise , there is a unique j2 ∈ { 0 , 1 , ·_·_· , r − 1 } such that UNK δ r α − 1 UNK rt − 3 ( ρ s ) j1 · rt − 2 ( ρ s ) j2 · rt − 1 = 1 consequently , we obtain j1 , ·_·_· , jt − 1 such that UNK δ r α − 1 UNK ( ρ s ) j1 · r ( ρ s ) j2 · r2 ·_·_· ( ρ s ) jt − 1 · rt − 1 = 1 thus , we have ( δ α ) r UNK ( ρ s ) j1 + j2 · r + ·_·_· jt − 1 · rt − 2 UNK r = δ it means that δ α ( ρ s ) j1 + j2 · rBRc ) + ( 1 , 2 ) = ( x , 2 ) + ( 1 , c ) ( x , c ) + ( a , b ) = ( x , b ) + ( a , c ) and reduce either ( x , 2 ) or ( x , b ) , as before . hence we may_assume that x does_not_appear with g1 in any pair in l and also , arguing in the same_way , we may_assume x does_not_appear with g2 in any pair in l . this means that l must_contain a g1 -
