( 1 ) the detector is trained by usingBR, a sequence ( ai : i < ω ) ⊂ b such that ai = p ↾ ( a , aj : j < i ) is a morley_sequence in tp ( a / a ) . this shows in particular that if π ( x , b ) does_not_divide over a , then there is a morley_sequence i in tp ( b / a ) such that { π ( x , b ′ ) : b ′ ∈ i } is consistent . conversely , suppose that π ( x , b ) divides over a , as witnessed by an a - indiscernible_sequence ( bi : i < ω ) in tp ( b / a ) with si < ω π ( x , bi ) inconsistent . take any morley_sequence i in tp ( b / a ) ( if there is none , 10 frank o . wagner we are done ) . by [ 5 , corollary 2 . 2 . 8 ] ( which is shown there for real tuples , but transfers easily to hyperimaginaries ) we may_assume that bii is a - conjugate to i for all i ∈ i and that ( bi : i < ω ) is indiscernible_over ai . if ¯ π ( x ) = sb ′ ∈ i π ( x , b ′ ) were consistent , then ( bi : i < ω ) would witness that d ( ¯ π ( x ) ∧ π ( x , b0 ) , π ( x , y ) , ψ ) < d ( ¯ π ( x ) , π ( x , y ) , ψ ) for some inconsistencyBR5 , 1 kt as a function of the ǫ is presented . to compare the conductivity in external_magnetic_field with the ones without magnetic_field we plot fig . 5 . from this plots one_sees_that in external_magnetic_field the insulator - semimetal phase_transition becomes_broader . the value of the conductivity in magnetic_field in the weak_coupling region is by an order of magnitude_smaller_than that without magnetic_field . the last fact can_be explained by the possible appearance of the another fermion_condensate which cannot_be adequately_described_by the staggered_fermions due the acknowledgments the authors are much obliged to dr . timo lahde who was the first to draw their attention to graphene field_theory . the authors are_grateful to prof . mikhail zubkov for interesting and useful_discussions . the work_was_supported_by grant_rfbr - 11 - 02 - 01227 - a and by the russian_ministry of science and education , under_contract_no .BR2 UNK − 3 + e4ibk + e4ick + e4i ( b + c ) k UNK cos ( 2ak ) − i UNK − 5 + e4ibk + e4ick + 4e2i ( b + c ) k − e4i ( b + c ) k UNK sin ( 2ak ) sin ( 2ak ) 9 , s ( i ) 1 , 2 ( k ) = i UNK − 3 + e4ibk + e4ick + e4i ( b + c ) k UNK cos ( 2ak ) + UNK − 5 + e4ibk + e4ick + 4e2i ( b + c ) k − e4i ( b + c ) k UNK sin ( 2ak ) 2 UNK − e2ibk − e2ick + e2i ( 2b + c ) k + e2i ( b + 2c ) k UNK sin ( 2ak ) , s ( i ) 2 , 1 ( k ) = s ( i ) 1 , 2 ( k ) , s ( i ) ( 2 , 2 ) ( k ) = − UNK − 1 + e4ibk UNK UNK − 1 + e4ick UNK − 2 UNK − 1 + e4i ( b + c ) k UNK cos ( 2ak ) − 2i UNK − 1 + e2i ( b + c ) k UNK 2 UNK − 3 + e4ibk + e4ick + e4i ( b + c ) k UNK cos ( 2ak ) − i UNK − 5 + e4ibk + e4ick + 4e2i ( b + c ) k − e4i ( b + c ) k UNK sin ( 2ak ) for the graph 1a ,BRmappings τ : c ( [ s , t ] ) → [ s , t ] satisfying { τ ≤ t } ∈ bs t ∀ s ≤ t ≤ t are called stopping_rules , following [ ks01 ] . we denote by bs the class of such stopping_rules starting at s . t ) s ≤ t ≤ t defined by bs t definition 2 . 1 ( elementary feed - back strategies ) fix 0 ≤ s ≤ t . an elementary strategy α starting at s , for the first intelligent player / controller is defined by • a finite non - decreasing_sequence of stopping_rules , i . eBR∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , referred to as the positive regrese { φ ( bp1 , . . . , bpn0 ) bpi = u } ↑ u ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , known as the positive dependence sion dependence on subset ( prds ) ( of the null p - values ) ; see , for example , benjamini and yekutieli ( 2001 ) or sarkar ( 2002 ) . assumption 2 ( b ) , less_restrictive_than assumption 2 ( a ) , is a weaker_version of the property : ( among the null p -
