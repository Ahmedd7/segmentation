[BRis a solution of system ( 1 . 1 ) . the main_result of the paper is the following . theorem 1 . 1 . let m be any connected 2 - manifold such that m 6 = s2 or rp2 and let α ∈ bn − 1 ( m ) . then the system of equations ( 1 . 1 ) for n - strand_braids β has a solution if and only if α satisfies the condition that d1 α = . . . = dn − 1 α . the technique of the proof is based_on the bi - ∆ - group structure on the pure_braid_groups of connected 2 - manifolds with nonempty boundary [ 12 ] as_well as the determination of brunnian braids on general connected 2 - manifolds [ 3 ] . our technology could not apply for the exceptional_cases m = s2 or rp2 , and so it_remains open whether system ( 1 . 1 ) has a solution for any α satisfying the condition in the theorem . on cohen_braids 3 the paper is organized_as_follows . in section 2 we remind bi - ∆ structures , define cohen_braids and prove the main theorem . in section 3 we study cohen_braids of the disc with smallBRarguments work asymptotically for evolution operators describing the interaction represented_by two - colour connected_graphs , such that each vertex contains_at_least one connection of each colour . to analyze to what extend this assumption can_be relaxed we investigated an l step interaction , described by a larger class of graphs with bonds of l different_colours . in the simplest_case , consider a chain of l + 1 subsystems , such that in each moment only two neighbouring subsystems are involved : in the first_step the first subsystem interacts_with the second , in the second_step the interaction couples subsystems two and three , an so on . this interaction can_be represented_by a chain of l + 1 vertices , such that all l bounds between the neighbouring vertices are of a different colour , associated_with the interaction in specific time_steps . figure 4 shows the level_spacing_distribution for such a model with l = 5 time_steps , u = w v xy z = ( w12 ⊗ w3 ⊗ w4 ⊗ w5 ⊗ w6 ) ·_·_· ( z1 ⊗ z2 ⊗ z3 ⊗ z4 ⊗ z56 ) .

[ active power ] or [ active power , apparent power ] , an aggregate stream ( e . g . mains ) and a sub - metered stream ( e . g . appliances or circuits ) . the parameter style for the train method is similar to that of the linear_regression fit function used in lm , which is as follows : fit < - lm ( y ∼ x1 + x2 + x3 , data = mydata ) disaggregate : this function takes as input a building and disaggregates the aggregate feed using the appliance models learnt during_training . the output is a disaggregated stream for individual_appliances . import model : this function should import a set of json appliance models into the nilmtk disaggregator . export model :BR2 = 1 ) and polarized ( σ 1 = − σ 2 = 1 ) obstacles , we have solved the system ( 1 ) numerically for these two cases using the input conditions ψ 1 , 2 = ( ρ 0 / 2 ) 1 / 2 exp ( iv x ) . typical results are illustrated in fig . 1 . for the non - polarized obstacle the density ship waves are located_outside the density mach_cone and a dark - dark_soliton is located_inside it . remarkably , the existence of the polarization mach_cone is not manifested at all in the density distributions of both condensate components — linear and nonlinear polarization waves are not excited by the non - polarized obstacle . in sharp_contrast , the polarized obstacle leads to much_richer dynamics and generates both density ship waves ( outside the outer mach_cone ) and polarization ship waves ( outside the inner mach_cone ) . the density waves oscillate in phase in both components what increases the amplitude of oscillations in the total density , whereas the counterphase oscillations in the condensate components in the polarization ship waves lead to cancelation of oscillations in the total density . the polarized obstacle does_not excite a usual dark - dark_soliton , but instead a more_complicated structure is generated in the vicinity of the polarization mach_cone . we_shall_call this structure an oblique breather since , as we_shall seeBRς + 1 a ( p2 0 0 + 1 ) UNK , where n and t are the density and the temperature of background_plasma , and e0 = qp2 0 + 1 − 1 , a = 4 π r2 ecn ln λ . here re is the electron radius and ln λ is the coulomb_logarithm . the spectrum of nonthermal_particles can_be presented as f ( p ) = ¯ f ( ¯ p / p ) ς + 1 , ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) – 11 – where ¯ f is determined from the conditions by fitting between the thermal and non - thermal components of the spectrum , and ¯ p is the momentum value at this boundary . in the quasi - stationary approximation when variations of f is quite_small the non - thermal component can_be presented as f ( p ) = − s α ( ς + 1 )BRj − → t t m where , ∀ z ∈ t t m , i − 1z = ( prhz , ♭ γ s ′ prv z ) , j − 1z = ( prv z , ♭ γ sprhz ) .
