to adequately compare different estimators we may use as similarity_measure_between them a similarity_measure of the processes they represent . in particular , we measure closeness between parameters representing two map2s by an empirical kullback - leibler_divergence ( from now on kl_divergence ) of their interarrival_times joint density functions : given two map2s , with associated matrices { d0 , d1 } and { d0 , d1 } , given the length n of the observed sequences and the number n of runs the experiment is repeated , we will measure the closeness between two map2s by means of the empirical kl_divergence dkl UNK { d0 , d1 } { d0 , d1 } UNK , dkl UNK { d0 , d1 } { d0 , d1 } UNK : = 1 n n log xi = 1 f ( t ( i ) { d0 , d1 } ) f ( t ( i ) { d0 , d1 } ) , where , for i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n , t ( i ) = ( t ( i ) times generated from { d0 , d1 } . 1 , . . . , t ( i ) n ) is a sequence of interarrival example 1 . as an example , we consider a sample of n = 500 interarrival_times simulated from the map2 with canonical form d0 = UNK − 20 0 − 0 . 5 UNK , 6 d1 = UNK 14 0 . 0426 0 . 4574 UNK . 0 ( 8 ) we_want to compare estimates as obtained from the method of moments , as discussed in section 4 . 1 below . the theoretical and empirical moments are givenBR) . a sequence of soft points in is considered as a cauchy_sequence in if corresponding to every such that , i . e . , . definition 2 . 25 .
