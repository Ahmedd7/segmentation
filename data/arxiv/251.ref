in each training step . designing a model is then done by the following steps : ( 1 ) choice of a prior p ( z ) over the latent_variables . ( 2 ) choice of recognition model q ( zx , θ r ) . the kullback - leibler_divergence_between the prior and the recognition model has to be tractable and efficient to compute . ( 3 ) choice of a generating model p ( xz , θ g ) , which is mostly given by the type of data under_investigation . we_want to stress that even if p ( z ) follows a distribution with a single maximum ( e . g . a gaussian ) and factorises , the induced p ( x ) will generally be multi - modal . first note_that to introduce dependencies_between the components of x , the map f : z UNK → x has merely to be a rotation . for introducing new modes , an_informal argument is more_involved . let x ∈ x , z ∈ z and f be a parametrised universal approximator (BRsibyll 2 . 33 epos 1 . 99 epos 1 . 99 ( lhc ) emc ( gamma ) : lpm gmf lpm + gmf no uhe - effects proton gamma 18 19 20 21 22 lg e ( ev ) 2 m c / g , x a m t 1050 1000_950_900 850_800 750_700_650 600_550 1030 g /_cm2 : proton iron 830 g /_cm2 : proton iron 614 g /_cm2 : proton iron 60_80_100 rms , m 120_140_160 energy dependences of root figure 1 . mean_square_radius of electron component in vertical air_showers initiated by protons , iron_nuclei ( corresponding to recently retuned hadronic models ) and gammas ( with and without uhe effects – lpm and geomagnetic ) at 890 g /_cm2 ( see_text for details ) . figure 2 . rms − tmax scatter_plot for 500 simulated vertical extensive_air showers_initiated by protons and iron_nuclei with e = 1018_ev at three observation depths ( 614 , 830 , 1028 g /_cm2 ) . afterBR69 ) and ( 70 ) and the unitarity of the pmns_matrix . the expression in eq .

( 75 ) 13 as in the case of type i seesaw_model , we can obtain an upper_bounds on the branching_ratios_br ( τ → µ + γ ) and br ( τ → e + γ ) of interest using their relation with br ( µ → e + γ ) and the current experimental upper_bound on br ( µ → e + γ ) . we have : br ( τ → µ ( e ) + γ ) br ( µ → e +BRh ) appears in the equation of state of such a fluid . finally , the ratio_between the two fluids of the model is given by ρ 1 ρ 2 = 4 ( t0 − t ) − 4 ( α − 1 ) 9z 2 0 ( 1 + ω eff ) 2 ( 2 α − 1 ) − 9z 2 0 ( 1 + ω eff ) 2 . ( 62 ) the positivity of this result depends_on the positivity of ρ 2 in ( 60 ) . from here we can see that near to the singularity , when the hubble_parameter diverges , the contribute of the fluid ( 55 ) disappears with_respect_to the one of the second fluid which in fact drives the phantom universe . 5 conclusions in this_paper , we have analyzed a two coupled fluids model by investigating several solutions for accelerated_universe in flat_frw space - time . the first fluid can reproduce the matter , and the second one is a dark_fluid bringing the acceleration . moreover , it is in general possible to recover also the standard matter_era as a solution of the model . beyond the removal of the coincidence_problem and the simplicity of the mathematical_treatment , we have seen in the specific_examples how the coupling can changeBR, 20 , 23 ] ) in which , at each step , all spins are independently tested . in such evolutions , costs are a possibly complicated function of the different patterns of spin_flips connecting the relevant states . in these cases it is therefore necessary to dissociate energy profiles from energy_barriers . the former are associated to invariant_measures and determine the set of stable and metastable_configurations . the latter are associated to transition_rates and determine drifts and exit_times . 1 . 2 . different approaches to metastability early approaches to metastability were based_on the computation of expected values with_respect_to restricted equilibrium states [ 51 ] . this paradigm is still influential in physics , see e . g . [ 39 ] . the influence of probability on statistical_mechanics led to an_alternative pattern of thoughts based_on stochastic_dynamics and focused_on their spectral properties and on the behavior of their typical trajectories . this point of view has given rise to differentBRshear ( savage & lun 1988 ; ottino & khakhar 2000 ; meier et_al . 2007 ) . in particular , sheared_granular mixtures differing in particle size present a common and challenging_problem in many industrial contexts due_to their tendency to form undesirable inhomogeneous particle configurations in tumblers , heaps , chutes , and silos ( pouliquen et_al . 1997 ; makse et_al . 1997 ; ottino & khakhar 2000 ; aranson & tsimring 2006 ; meier et_al . 2007 ; fan et_al . 2012 ; bridgwater 2012 ) . these sorted ( or unmixed ) configurations resulting from size segregation occur also in natural_phenomena such as debris flows ( iverson 1997 ) . many studies_have_been_devoted to understanding the underlying_mechanisms and developing predictive frameworks for size segregation and pattern_formation in polydisperse ,BR, freedman r . s . , 2008 , apj , 678 , 1419 fortney j . j . , shabram m . , showman a . p . , lian y . , freedman r . s . , marley m . s . , lewis n . k . , 2010 , apj , 709 , 1396 fossati l . , ayres t . r . , haswell c . a . , bohlender d . , kochukhov_o . , floer l . , 2013 , apj , 766 , l20 fossati l . et_al . , 2010 , apj , 714 , l222 haswell cBRfrom each image and re - orders them , so that after selection and reordering , the matrix formed by these feature_vectors can_be decomposed_into a low - rank matrix and a sparse_matrix . the so formulated roml problem belongs_to a more_general_class of multi - index assignment_problem ( miap ) , which is proven to be np - hard [ 13 ] . exact_solution methods are prohibitively_slow for practical use . in this_work , we treat roml , more_specifically simultaneous optimization of multiple ppms , as a regularized consensus problem in the context of distributed_optimization [ 9 ] . we use the alternatingBRo ( r2 ) we_believe the discussion of rapidity scaling in our footnote 2 still_applies to ref . [ 60 ] . a common goal of both our work and ref . [ 60 ] is the inclusion of fixed - order_corrections from the low - energy matrix_elements ( corresponding to beam and / or soft functions ) that are needed as ingredients in a calculation at n3ll order . in our analysis we have fully calculated the o ( α 2 s ) soft function , including the r - dependent anomalous_dimension and finite corrections that depend_on ln r2 . in addition , we have calculated the finite corrections in the beam function that depend_on ln r2 . thus , the dominant r dependence has_been fully_determined analytically , and the only numerical ingredient is the remaining contribution in the beam function . in contrast , in ref . [ 60 ] an analytic calculation is done for the anomalous_dimension terms , but a numerical extraction is done for the combined finite soft + beam contributions including their r dependence . we make_use of the rapidity renormalization_group in our analysis , including rapidity scale variations in our uncertainties to estimate the size of higher - order rapidity_logarithms , while ref . [ 60 ] accounts_for these contributions using the “ collinear anomaly ” formalism without variations of the rapidity scales . a resummationBR( l ( n , ⋆ ) ) = 0 for all i > 0 and n ≥ v . therefore in this case ( 4 . 1 ) reg ( l ( n , ⋆ ) ) = maxn µ : h 0 now consider the finite collection a + ( l ( n , ⋆ ) ) µ 6 = 0o for all n ≥ v . d : = { r ( e1 , ⋆ ) , r ( e2 , ⋆ ) , . . . , r ( et , ⋆ ) , l ( u , ⋆ ) } . since each member of d is finitely_generated n - graded a = a0 [ x1 , . . . , xd ] - module , we may_assume that every member of d is generated in degrees ≤ k1 for some k1 ∈ n . since l is a finitely_generated nt - graded r - module and a + is an ideal of a ( = r ( 0 , ⋆ ) ) , by lemma 3 . 3 , there_exists a positive_integer k2 such that ( 4 . 2 ) ( a + ) k2 l ( n , ⋆ ) ∩ h 0 a + ( l ( n , ⋆ ) ) = 0 for all n ∈ nt . now set k : = k1 + k2 . we claim that ( 4 . 3 ) h 0 a + ( l ( n , ⋆ ) ) µ = 0 for all n ≥ v and µ ≥ n − uk + k . to show ( 4 . 3 ) , fix
