combinatorial track_finding algorithms that are currently standard is that the execution_time is linear with_respect_to the number of hits present in the event , while combinatorial algorithms , as the number of combinations increases much_more_rapidly with_respect_to the number of hits , show a worse dependence on the number of hits . in addition , the hough_transform is naturally tolerant of missing hits or hits that do_not – 5 – x ( cm ) - 100 - 50050100y ( cm ) - 100 - 50050100x ( cm ) - 100 - 50050100y ( cm ) - 100 - 50050100 exactly fit the candidate features , due_to limited resolution or the discretization used in computing the parameter_space . while the hough_transform is more_expensive to implement for a small number of hits , the ability to take_advantage of multithreading offers the chance of significantly_improved performance for events with a large number of tracks . one should note_that this_paper does_not_imply that executing machine_vision and pattern_recognition algorithms is necessarily more_appropriate forBRγ 5 k γ 6 k γ 4 k γ 1 γ 7 γ 2 γ 8 γ 3 γ 9 − o λ processor γ 12 13 14 15 k 0 γ γ γ 10 11 0 k fig . 7 . wimax siso block scheme usually optimized architectures [ masera et_al . , 1999 ] ; [ bickerstaff et_al . , 2003 ] ; [ kim & park , 2008 ] are obtained with sp = 1 , whereas flexible architectures have higher sp values [ vogt & wehn , 2008 ] ; [ muller et_al . , 2009 ] . however , even with sp = 1 , a double binary turbo_decoder architecture that achieves the throughput imposed by wimax with eight iterations ( i = 8 ) , would_require fclk = 600_mhz . a possible solution to improve the throughput by a factor that ranges in [ 1 . 2 , 1 . 9 ] is the based_on decoder level_parallelism [ muller et_al . 2006 ] and is usually_referred to as “ shuffling ” [ zhang & fossorier , 2005 ] . however , to further_improve the throughput a parallel decoder made of p sisos working concurrently is required . as a consequence , a parallel architecture achieves a throughput t  i [ 2  sp  nk  n (BR- probability events are satisfied , and derive bounds on regret conditional on the clean execution . the analysis of a clean execution does_not_involve_any “ probabilistic ” arguments . this approach tends_to simplify regret analysis . we start by listing some simple invariants enforced by agnosticzooming : 17 invariant 6 . 1 . in each_round t of each execution of agnosticzooming : ( a ) all active cells are relevant , ( b ) each candidate contract is contained in some active cell , ( c ) wt ( c ) ≤ 5 radt ( c ) for each active composite cell c . note_that the zooming rule is essential to ensure invariant 6 . 1 ( c ) . 6 . 1 analysis of the randomness definition 6 . 2 ( clean execution ) . an execution of agnosticzooming is called clean if for each_round t and each active cell c it holds that u ( c ) − ut ( c ) ≤ radt ( c ) , virtwidth ( c ) − wt ( c ) ≤ 4 radt ( c ) ( if c is composite ) .

photon_interferences in [ 24 , 25 , 26 ] . in these experiments , the entanglement was encoded in a time - bin basis realized by interferometers with multiple arms . time bins have_been preferentially used as a basis for entangled_qudits because_they can_be coherently manipulated by interferometers . however , the scalability to higher_dimensions becomes prohibitively complex in view of interferometric stability . by directly manipulating the photon spectrum , we demonstrate the implementation of various discretization_schemes to realize entangled_qudits . for this purpose we coherently address selected spectral components of the entangled_photons by a spatial_light_modulator ( slm ) and make_use of an ultrafast_optical coincidence_detection , i . e . sum - frequency generation ( sfg ) [ 27 , 28 ] . as compared to the aforementioned experiments using interferometric methods , this procedure is intrinsically phase stable and potentially scalable to very_high dimensions . it has_been_used to investigate frequency - bin entangled_qudits by quantum_state_tomography and bell measurements [ 29 ] . in this_paper , we demonstrate the versatility of the experiment by discretizing the versatile shaper - assisted discretization of energy - time entangled_photons 3 continuous frequency space not only in frequency bins but in different other relevant orthogonal_bases . specifically , in the time - bin basis and a basis obtained by a schmidt_decomposition . moreover , we show that the presented method is well_suited to gain physical_insights , e . g . with_respect_to the coherence_time of the entangled_photons in the time - bin basis . the projection_onto schmidt modes further lays the groundwork for a reconstruction of the spdc state in terms of the schmidt basis in the frequency_domain . the paper is organized_as_follows : in section 2 weBRf03t01 when 2d is not enough , go for an extra_dimension thierry rabilloud 1 , 2 , 3 1 : cnrs , laboratory of chemistry and biology of metals ( lcbm ) , umr 5249 , grenoble , france 2 : univ . grenoble_alpes , lcbm , grenoble , france 3 : cea , irtsv / lcbm , grenoble france postal_address pro -

yyy ] . this technique keeps the quantitative_analysis of the protein amounts and combines it with a strongly improved identification process by mass_spectrometry , removing identification ambiguities in most_cases . in some favorable cases , post - translational variants can_be separated by this procedure . this versatile and easy to use technique is anticipated to be a very_valuable addition to the toolbox used in 2d gel - based proteomics . main_text because of its robustness , capacity to handle large sample series , easy interface with many other biochemical techniques and above all its unique ability to analyse complete proteins , 2d gel_electrophoresis is still a relevant approach in many proteomic studies [ 1 , 2 ] . in most_cases , 2d gel_electrophoresis is used as a first quantitative screening process to select the spots which abundance change upon the biological phenomenon ofBR( m ) , is a directed_graph with a vertex labeled with m for each m ∈ m , and with an edge from m to m ′ iff there is an attribute , say r [ a ] , with r [ a ] ∈ rhs ( m ) and er [ a ] ∩ lhs ( m ′ ) 6 = ∅ . 3 . m is strongly acyclic if amdg ( m ) has no cycles . ✷ because r [ a ] ∈ er [ a ] , for any set m of mds , all edges in mdg ( m ) are also edges in amdg ( m ) .BR( 1 + x ′ ) − nyj , µ ¯ by µ e j σ + ¯ by ′ µ j σ . where x denotes the pair ( x1 , x2 ) and x ′ denotes the variables of g . hence hf ( x , x ′ ) satisfies inequalities of type ( 35 ) with a constant cn , f , ¯ a proportional to kf ka , b . invoking remark 2 , we arrive again at ( 38 ) , which completes the proof . remark 4 . the condition g ∩ v = { 0 } implies that g is contained in a wedge of the form { ( x1 , x2 ) : x1 − x2 ∈ g } , where g is a closed cone in r4 having only the origin in common with the closed light_cone ¯ v . the norm ( 31 ) dominates the euclidean_norm k · k and using the parallelogram identity , we see that for all x1 − x2 ∈ g , the following_inequality_holds : ( u ψ , φ ∗ f ) ( x1 , x2 ) ≤BRferry . it continues to get about 50_% scaling for euler and 40 % for advection , despite the large number of cores . this bodes_well for the programmer who can scale the code on a current core such as the westmere . 4 conclusion in the paper we demonstrated an easy - to - use system that allows clawpack users to utilize intra - node parallelism with reasonable scaling results . the work is far_from done as there still needs several parts of the algorithm to complete . notably , limiters , dynamic time_stepping , and automatic mesh_refinement . additionally , we expect to explore several other libraries for parallelism , especially thrust , intel smpd program 4 figure 1 : timing and scaling of different grids on advection problems using westmere . compiler , opencl , and cuda . references [ 1 ] david i ketcheson , kyle t mandli , aron ahmadia , amal alghamdi , manuel quezada , matteo parsani , matthew g knepley , and matthew emmett . accessible , extensible , scalable tools for wave_propagation problems . arxiv . org , math . na , november_2011 .
