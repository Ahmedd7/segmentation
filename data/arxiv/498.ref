( 3 . 41 ) the connected functions are a different story . because the scalar_product behaves 4note_that we use commas to separate the variables in UNK r ( x1 ) , . . . , r ( xn ) UNK c to make it clear that the connected functions are not obtained as the average of a product of random_fields . 59 linearly , UNK UNK x1 dx r ( x ) f ( x ) + UNK x2 dx r ( x ) f ( x ) , dx r ( x ) f ( x ) = we have that the partition_function of r ( x ) is given by the product z [ f ( x ) ] = z [ f ( x ) ] x1 z [ f ( x ) ] x2 .

consistent and microscopic way with the covariant density_functional theory . the newly_observed quadrupole_moments data for 107 − 129cd together_with their linear increase tendency with the neutron number are excellently reproduced without_any ad_hoc parameters . instead of the linear neutron occupation mechanism in h11 / 2 shell , the simplicity of the linear increase is revealed to be due_to the pairing correlation which smears_out the abrupt_changes induced by the single - particle shell structure , and thus leads to a smooth shape evolution . furthermore , it is found that the core is strongly_coupled with the valence_nucleons , and thus the core polarization effects are turned_out to be essential which contribute almost half of the total quadrupole_moments . the authors are_grateful to q . b . chen , z . h . zhang , and h . z .BRin the fold determine the uncertainty in period . the best - fit period via the trial folds is 0 . 910022 ± ( 5 × 10 − 6 ) days . 2 . 2 . average light_curves the 16 quarters of long - cadence filtered data for koi2700 were epoch - folded about the best determined period of porb = 0 . 910022 days . the folded data were then averaged into 200 bins per orbit , corresponding to a bin_width of 6 . 5 minutes . the results are shown in fig . 1 ( left_panel ) . the transit profile is obviously quite asymmetric , with a sharp ingress and much_longer egress tail . the corresponding light_curve produced from the two available quarters of short - cadence data are shown in the right_panel of fig . 1 . because of the lower statistical_precision of the short - cadence data ( by a factor of ∼ √ 8 due_to the × 8 shorter baseline ) we put the folded data into only 100 phase bins . in spite of the reduced statistical_precision of the short - cadence data , the sameBRlayer topological_insulator ( ti ) is , to the best of our_knowledge , experimentally_demonstrated for the first time . the few - layer ti : bi2se3 ( 2 - 4 layer_thickness ) is fabricated by the liquid - phase exfoliation method , and has a low saturable optical intensity of 53 mw /_cm2 measured by the z - scan technique . the optical deposition technique is used to induce the few - layer ti in the solution onto a fiber ferrule for successfully constructing the fiber - integrated ti - based saturable_absorber ( sa ) . by inserting this sa into the ydf laser_cavity , stable q - switching operation at 1 . 06 μ m is achieved . the q - switched pulses have the shortest pulse_duration of 1 . 95 μ s , the maximum pulse energy of 17 . 9 nj and a tunable pulse - repetition - rate from 8 . 3 to 29 . 1 khz . our results_indicate that the ti as a sa is also available at 1 μ m waveband , revealing its potential as another wavelengthBR. 3 mw of power and an acquisition time of 30 s . the 2d peak is approximately four times the g peak , which corresponds_to monolayer graphene25 . still a small_amount of defects can_be observed due_to non -

5  m ) , the dark zones correspond_to si_substrate , and ni ( bright color ) appears forming clusters separated inside the si zones and completely separated from the cu phase . this image shows the dewetting isolating a ni island and the graphene growth on si . also , how the graphene wrinkles formed on graphene terraces overlap . this process usually takes_place during_annealing of the cu / ni bilayer previously sputtered on c -

shed limit have shown that a universal formula can predict the fastest allowed spin frequency as_well ( haensel & zdunik 1989 ; friedman et_al . 1989 ; lasota et_al . 1996 ) . however , the dependence of the maximum spin frequency on x and ¯ ω is not directly shown in these formulae . the dependencies of these secondary properties on the two dimensionless_ratios do depend_on the eos , but only very weakly , so that it is possible to create very_good approximate formulae for the secondary properties . the approximate formulae for the secondary properties are found by ( 1 ) choosing a library of representative eos ; ( 2 ) computing neutron_star models numerically for a reasonable range of mass , radius and spin values for the eos ; ( 3 ) computing the dimensionless_ratios and the desired secondary properties ; and ( 4 ) finding the best_fit approximations for each property . for our approximate formulae , we choose a library of representative eos that span the range of stiffness allowed by observations . the approximate formulae do depend_on the choice of eos , but the errors introduced are small . we explore this dependence
