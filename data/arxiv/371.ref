( 224 ) serves_as an estimate of the potential of orbital decay measurements to test gr . finally , it is important to point that the parametrization ( 224 ) does_not_include all possible deformations from gr . for example it does_not_include corrections due_to massive_scalar_fields [ 92 ] . these and other possible corrections can nonetheless be included by modifying the parametrization ( 217 ) – ( 219 ) , although this is beyond our scope . 1 . degeneracy with environmental_effects the presence of matter distributions mostly introduces conservative corrections to the waveform . however , dynamical_friction introduces dissipative_effects that modify the flux formula , cf . eq .
