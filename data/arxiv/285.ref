the character table is given in table i . the symmetries , under g2 , of all rotational quantum states of indole ( h2o ) in its vibronic_ground_state are obtained directly by correlating a1 , 2 and b1 , 2 symmetries in g4 to a and b in g2 , respectively . they are provided in table_iii . torsional sublevels with the same quantum number σ have the same symmetry ( a for all σ = 0 sublevels and b for all σ = 1 levels ) . the nonzero µ a and µBRfield covers 0 . 8 kpc × 0 . 8 kpc at the distance of m31 . all of the significant substructure discovered during the course of the int /_wfc survey is sampled by our data . the inner ellipse has a semimajor_axis of 2 ◦ ( 27 kpc ) and represents an inclined disc with i = 77 . ◦ 5 and position_angle of 38 . ◦ 1 . the outer ellipse , of semimajor_axis length 4 ◦ ( 55 kpc ) , roughly indicates the spatial_extent of the int survey . temporal_evolution of the star_formation_rate and chemical_enrichment_history can_be extracted . quantitative star_formation_history work is , to_some_extent , still in its_infancy . while a great_deal of progress_has_been_made in charting the sfhs of dwarf_galaxies in the local group ( lg ;
