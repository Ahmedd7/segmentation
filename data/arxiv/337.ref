( 1 . 4 ) the research in the framework of the weighted l1 - data was also developed more_precisely to ( 1 . 4 ) in the recent_results due_to [ 15 ] and [ 10 ] . especially [ 15 ] dealt_with the nonlinear problems of ( 1 . 4 ) . the decay property and the asymptotic profiles to the equation ( 1 . 4 ) are well - studied in [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] and [ 21 ] . as compared with the equation ( 1 . 4 ) , there seems to be few results about the asymptotic profiles of solutions to the equation ( 1 . 1 ) , so it is good_chance to present a way to investigate the asymptotic_behavior of solutions to ( 1 . 1 ) - ( 1 . 2 ) . in this connection , quite_recently vigorous works about the global_existence of solutions and / or a new method to derive sharper decay estimates of the total energy to the cauchy_problem of the equation utt − ∆ u
