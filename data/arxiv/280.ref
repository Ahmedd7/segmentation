to - head comparisons and offline optimization in a commercial search_engine . 6 . conclusions in this_work , we formulate a class of optimization_problems in search_engines as a contextual_bandit problem , and focus_on the offline policy_evaluation problem . our_approach uses counterfactual analytic techniques to obtain an_unbiased_estimate of the true policy value , without the need to run the policy onBRthe lowest_order diagrams of b → φ φ as shown in fig . 1 . in pqcd , the decay amplitude is factorized_into the soft part φ , the hard part h , and the harder one ci characterized_by different scales . it is conceptually written_as , m ∼ z dx1dx2dx3b1db1b2db2b3db3t r [ c ( t ) φ b ( x1 , b1 ) φ φ ( x2 , b2 ) φ φ ( x3 , b3 ) h ( xi , bi , t ) st ( xi ) e − s ( t ) ] , ( 9 ) where xi denotes the momentum_fraction of a light_quark in each meson , and bi is the conjugate space coordinate of the transverse_momentum . t r means the trace over dirac and color_indices , 5 and c ( t ) is the wilson_coefficient evaluated at scale t . the universal wave_function φ m ( m = b , φ ) describes hadronization of a quark and an anti -
