the beam . the time - averaged momentum density of the beam ( i . e . , momentum per_unit_volume ) , pz = < sz > / c2 , is thus uniform throughout the free - space region , having equal contributions from the two frequency components of the beam . refractive_index = n ( f ) incident_beam transmitted z fig . 1 . a light beam consisting of two equal - amplitude plane - waves of slightly differing frequencies , f1 and f2 , is normally_incident on a semi - infinite dielectric of refractive_index n ( f ) . the beam is linearly_polarized , having its e - field along the x - axis and h - field along the y - axis . while a fraction of the beam is reflected at the surface , the remainder enters the dielectric , penetrating it at the group velocity vg = c / ( n + n ′ f ) . here f = ½ ( f1 + f2 ) isBRin the dual_cone c ∗ − along the line spanned_by e . interestingly , in cases where the ellipsoids are far_apart , the cone c − will be narrow , and so the boundary of the dual_cone will essentially be the orthogonal_complement of e . as such , the pseudoprojection is close the true projection_onto the polar_cone in this limiting_case . for this pseudoprojection to be well - defined , we require that for every g , the line which passes_through g in the direction of e hits the dual_cone at some point . this is not always the case , as the second example_illustrates . it is straightforward to show that this pseudoprojection is well - defined if and only if the ellipsoids remain separated when projecting_onto the line spanned_by e . proposition 3 . 6 is essentially a statement_about convex_duality , and while it provides an_upper_bound on w ∩ , in our case , it is difficult to find a closed_form expression for the right - hand_side . however , the bound is in terms of distance to the dual_cone , and so any point in this cone provides an_upper_bound on this sends any vector g to a point in c ∗ ( but_not_necessarily the closest_point ) , while at the same time allowing distance . this leads to the second main_ingredient in our analysis : we choose a convenient mapping UNK π that the expectation of UNK g − UNK π ( g ) UNK 2 to have a closed_form . since UNK g − π c ∗ ( g ) UNK 2 ≤ UNK g − UNK π ( g ) UNKBReigenfuction . these eigenvalues with multiplicity are arranged by increasing order and we denote λ c n ( s ) the n - th cuspidal eigenvalue of s . for an_arbitrary fuchsian_group γ , it is not known whether the cardinality of the set of cuspidal eigenvalues of h / γ is infinite . however , a famous theorem of a . selberg says_that it is the case when γ is arithmetic . any cuspidal eigenpair ( λ , f ) with λ ≤ 1 4 is called a small cuspidal eigenpair and in that case , λ and f are respectively called a small cuspidal eigenvalue and a small cuspidal eigenfunction . in [ o - r ] , jean - pierre otal and eulalio rosas proved that the total_number of small eigenvalues of any hyperbolic surface of type ( g , n ) is at_most 2g − 3 + n . in the same paper they formulate the following : conjecture . let s be a noncompact , finite area hyperbolic surface of type ( g , n ) . then λ cBRfix the counts of the e - step to those computed by fa , trained for the default 5 iterations , to aid the convergence_rate , and optimize the m - step only . let θ be the parameters for our model . then the gradient for each sentence is given by ∂ ∂ θ UNK log p ( fe ) = j UNK i UNK k = 1 l = 0 UNK i p ( lk , i , j ) p ( fkel ) i = 0 p ( ik , i , j ) p ( fkei ) log ( p ( lk , i , j ) p ( fkel ) ) UNK · ∂ ∂ θ where the first part are the counts from the fa model and second_part comes_from our model . we compute the gradient for the alignment probabilities in the same_way as in the fa model , and the gradient for the translation probabilities using back - propagation ( rumelhart et_al . , 1986 ) . for parameter update , we use adagrad as the gradient_descent_algorithm ( duchi_et_al . , 2011 ) . 5 experiments we first evaluate the alignment error_rate of our_approach , which establishes the model ’_s ability to both learn alignments as_well as word representations thatBRfor instance : • if a has at_most 12 elements or at_most 50 member - sets ; • if the number n of member - sets is large compared to the number m of elements , that is , when n ≥ 2 • if n is small compared to m : when n ≤ 2m ( where we need to assume_that a is separating , that is , for any two elements there_exists a member - set containing exactly_one of them ) ;

[ 17 ]BRsection showed a very_interesting property : suppose that the relay is stationary ( or is moving very_slowly ) and that the current level of symbol energy etx is very_small . if etx increases_slightly , then the throughput may only increase slightly while the transmission energy of each packet may increase significantly . in fact , our example showed_that is sometimes better to operate the system at an even higher symbol energy level to reduce packet_transmission energy ( while at the same time also increase the network_throughput ) . in this section , we will propose a “ timeit 10 sharing ” approach to further_reduce packet_transmission energy . the idea is very_simple . instead of using only one symbol energy level , we allow the use of two levels , etx low and etx high . for each packet , when it is first transmitted , the sensor_node will randomly_select whether the packet should_be sent using the symbol energy level etx low ( with a probability 1 − q ) or etx high ( with a probability q ) . once the level is determined , the packet will be transmitted using the same symbol energy level for all subsequent retransmissions . it_turns_out_that this timesharing approach can reduce packet_transmission energy and also offer an_opportunity to provide priority service to transmit delay - sensitive packets . as before , we will model the whole communications process with a markov_chain , which consists of the following states low , fi high , i = 1 , . . . , n UNK
