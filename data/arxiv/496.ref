( 49 ) in [ 38 – 41 ] and more_recently in [ 11 ] it was shown how to find the eigenfunctions and the eigenvalues of the schrodinger_equation by means of its admitted lie_symmetries . we apply this method to the schrodinger_equation ( 46 ) and find the same results as in [ 16 ] . let_us_rewrite the lie point symmetries ( 47 ) of equation ( 46 ) in complex form , i . e . : σ 1 = i ∂ t , σ 2 ± = e ± 2i ω t ∂ t ∓ ie ± 2i ω t 3 ωBRall been shown to extend the boundaries of traditional network_reciprocity ( nowak and may , 1992 ) past its limits on isolated networks ( santos_et_al . , 2006 ; ohtsuki et_al . , 2006 ; preprint_submitted_to journal of theoretical_biology april 4 , 2014 szab_´_o and f ´_ath , 2007 ; perc et_al . , 2013 ) . here we_wish to extend the scope of evolutionary_games on interdependent_networks by_introducing rewards for highenough evolutionary fitness of individual players in the form of additional links that bridge the gap_between two initially disconnected populations . we introduce a utility threshold e that , if met or exceeded , allows the pertinent player to connect with the corresponding player in the other network . these rewards effectively introduce interdependence_between the two populations , and they allow the rewarded players to increase their utility with a fraction of the utility of the player in the other population . however , as_soon as the fitness of a player no_longer reaches the threshold , its external link is terminated , although it may eventually be re - awarded if and when the utility of the player again becomes sufficiently_large . importantly , the onoff nature of the interdependence_between the corresponding players in the two populations draws exclusively on the current level of fitness , without_regard of previous evolutionary success or strategy . we consider the weak prisoner_’_s_dilemma_game as representative for social_dilemmas that are governed_by pairwise_interactions , and the public_goods_game which is representative for social_dilemmas that are governed_by group interactions . we also consider different_types of networks to describe the interactions_among players in each of the two structured_populations . as we will show , regardless of these detailsBRused a ∗ gchristian @_triumf . ca pair of 4 ′ ′ × 4 ′ ′ nai_detectors to count g rays resulting from positron_annihilation in the target walls . the efficiency of the nai counters was calibrated using a 22na_source with activity of ∼ 1 m c . for 1169 kev protons , they quote a yield of ( 6 . 5 ± 0 . 3 ) × 10 − 10 and from this extract a resonance strength of wg = 1 . 13 ± 0 . 07 ev according_to the following : formula for a integrating the breit -

law_tail , and thus the conditions of the generalized central - limit theorem are satisfied . the landau distribution arises in the fully stochastic model for the same reasons ; the only difference being an overall shift in the distribution . thus , the lea -
