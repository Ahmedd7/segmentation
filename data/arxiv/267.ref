[ 13 ] and references_therein ) . for simplicity we keep in the two - channel model the same lattice model as for the single - channel hamiltonian ( 1 , 2 ) .BRfinally , the universal_coefficient theorem for cohomology states that for every k ∈ z there is an_exact_sequence 0 → ext1 r ( hk − 1 ( x ; r ) , g ) β k − − → h k ( x ; g ) α k − − →_homr ( hk ( x ; r ) , g ) → 0 . in what_follows , we write as usual α k ( η ) ξ = h η , ξ i for η ∈ h k ( x ; g ) and ξ ∈ hk ( x ; r ) . now our theorem reads as follows : theorem 2 . 1 . let e and f be real or complex bundles_over the closed r - orientable_manifold x of dimension n . let l : e → f be a bundle_morphism and let c be a characteristic class having values in h k ( · ; gBRx f n + 1 2 ( ξ 3 ) UNK x f l , n + 1 2 δ wk , n + 1 2 2 n ) UNK UNK δ wj , n + 1 l , n UNK UNK δ wj , n + 1 − x f 2 − ω jk ∆ t / 2 UNK δ wk , n + 1 2 − ω jk ∆ t / 2 UNK , for some ξ 3 on the line between x f n and x f n + 1 2 . 25 n ≡ m ( 1 ) setting m f x f n , and δ wn + 1 n + m ( 3 ) n + m ( 2 ) is independent of x f 2 n and x f . n + 1 2 n , it is clear that e [ m f n fn ] = 0 since δ wn is independent of all that remains is to bound the magnitude of e [ km f terms in m ( 2 ) fact that δ wn + 1 n kp ] . looking_at two of the i , n , for example , the uniform_bound on the first derivatives of g , together_with the is independent of both x f n kp ] and e [ kn f n and δ wn leads to 2 n + 1 2 ( x f leads to ∂ gij ∂ xk n and x f n ) hklm ( x f e UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK n ) δ wl , n δ wm , n δ wj , n + 1 and the uniform_bound onBRzp < − a , ρ p < b } .

( 5 ) corollary 1 . let τ > 0 , and let c = ( cj ) j ≥ 0 be a real sequence with c0 = 1 and generating_function f . then the following are equivalent .

(BRkey monic ) or is realized in g . furthermore , we may_assume that a is a good cover set such that the key monic is either defined on at_least four parts , or is defined on exactly three parts and there are no other monics in a defined on all of the remaining parts . we call such a good cover set a star cover set . finally , if possible , we choose a which is ( i , j ) - free for some distinct i , j ∈ { 2 , . . . , m − 1 } ; where a cover set a is ( i , j ) - free if no members of a are defined on both vi and vj . 6 . 1 . 1 ‘ minimal ’ cover sets : minimum number of members before_embarking_on the proof of the theorem , we fully describe our set - up , introduce the necessary new notions that will be used , and cover some_preliminary_results involving these . first note_that each c01 - cover set in o ( g ) is a subset of the set of all monics in o ( g ) which are defined on v0 and v1 . we_wish to consider c01 - cover sets with exactly c01 members ( that is , c01 - cover sets that contain exactly_one monic with c - coloured e01 - edge for each c ∈ c01 ) . so let r : = c01 , c01 = { 0 , 1 , . . . , r − 1 } , and let λ be the set of all c01 - cover sets in o ( g ) of size r . it is straightforward to see that weBRin this case low altitude layers have the sensitivity of the overlapping case and for higher layers the sensitivity converges to that of the fully separated case . the initial drop in the curves is due_to the strong altitude dependance of the amplitude of the covariance peak , higher layers have larger scintillation signals and so lower noise_levels . the increase in noise at_higher_altitudes is due_to the reduction in overlap of the projected pupils , increasing the statistical noise . tion the covariance peak will also move allowing estimation of the wind_velocity . wind_velocity profiling is difficult with single camera scidar . this is because each layer contributes three peaks to the covariance_function which quickly_become spatially confused in the spatio – temporal covariance_function . this prohibits the use of geometric algorithms and instead one must identify the layers using a spatio – temporal fourier_analysis . the wavelets approach of garc_í a - lorenzo & fuensalida ( 2006 ) relies_on measuring the spatial frequencies inherent in the separation of the correlation peaks .
