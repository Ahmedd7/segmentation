( l is then carried_by τ ′ . ) we will use the notation τ 1 ≺ τ 2 to indicate that τ 1 is a splitting of τ 2 ; we write τ 2 ≻ τ 1 to indicate that τ 2 is a pinching of τ 1 . if l is fully carried_by τ 2 , and τ 1 is a splitting of τ 2 respecting l , then we write τ 1 ≺ l τ 2 . lemma 4 . 4 ( splitting lemma ) . suppose τ ′ is a splitting of τ ֒_→ ( ¯ sBRto be used for studying cold dense_qcd matter , not only because it is shown to have a reasonably_well convergence behaviour , but also the model has the ability to estimate its inherent systematic_uncertainties via a dependence on the renormalization_scale parameter . the dyson - schwinger model [ 17 , 24 , 25 ] provides a continuum approach to qcd that can simultaneously address both confinement and dynamical_chiral_symmetry_breaking . for the phenomenological extending of the effective_interaction to finite chemical_potential_µ b , several_studies on hybrid_stars [ 17 , 24 ] have introduced a free parameter α to control the rate of approaching asymptotic_freedom . a range of α = 0 ∼ 4 has_been_used in their calculations . in the present_work , for nss , two eos models are chosen : the variational_method ( labelled as apr ) and the bhf_approach ( labelled as bhf ) . two chosen models for hybrid_stars are : the matching of an apr nuclear_eos with a perturbative_qcd quark eos ( labelled as pqcd ) , and the matching of a bhf nuclear_eos with a dyson - schwinger quark eos ( labelled as dsm ) . the standard gibbs construction is used for the matching . that is , the pressure p is taken to be the same in the hadron - quark mixed phase to ensure mechanical_stability , and would increase_monotonically with baryon_chemical_potential µ b . in the mean time , a global_charge_neutrality is assumed . under these matching criteria , there are two_possibilities for the “ apr + pqcdBR2010 ) UNK UNK d ϑ d ϕ √ − g ρ 2 UNK ϑ − π UNK d ϑ d ϕ √ − g ρ 2 2 UNK 2 UNK δ UNK = , ( 16 ) where the scale_height is weighted by the square of the density and the integrals are over all cells within a given radial shell . this is a different weighting than we have used in earlier_works ( e . g . fragile et_al . 2007 ) . this new expression is preferred because it gives a better_agreement_with the target δ ∗ that we use in our cooling function . note , however , that the value we_get from this estimate of UNK δ UNK does_not_necessarily agree_quantitatively with other estimates . for example , oneBR, j . pei , e . chen , and h . li . towards context - aware search by learning a very_large variable length hidden_markov_model from search logs . in www 2009 .

( 5 ) in the case of three - qubit_states these equations are sufficient to construct the gsd as follows . for each single - qubit_state uki there is , up to an_arbitrary phase , a unique single - qubit_state vki orthogonal to it . then from ( 5 ) it_follows that the product states u1u2v3i , u1v2u3i , v1u2u3i are orthogonal to ψ i and ( 5 ) can_be written_as hu1 ψ i = λ 0u2u3i + λ 1v2v3i , hu2 ψ i = λ 0u1u3i + λ 2v1v3i , hu3 ψ i = λ 0u1u2i + λ 3v1v2i .
