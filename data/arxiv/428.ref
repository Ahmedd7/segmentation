this figure are results from a three - dimensional calculation with a box_size 1 % of that used to generate the results in figure 9 . it was_argued in § 3 and appendix a that certain terms in the vorticity_equation should dominate in rdt . in particular , for a planar mean flow in the x - direction , the x - component of the stretching and dilation terms should cancel , and the y - and z - components of the stretching term should_be negligible . figure 12 demonstrates the former and figure 13 demonstrates the latter for the calculation shown in figure 9 . both figures also include the baroclinic_term for comparison . the quantitiesBRsome class of c - morphisms . definition 2 . 5 [ 7 ] a c - object x is called : • h - injective if for every e : y → z in h and every c - morphism f : y → x , there_exists a c - morphism g : z → x such that g ◦ e = f . • a cogenerator in c if for every pair of distinct f , g ∈ c ( y , z ) , there_exists h ∈ c ( z , x ) such that h ◦ f 6 = h ◦ g . note : in many familiar categories , h is usually taken to be the class of all embeddings in these categories , in which case the term ‘ h - injective ’ is shortened to just ‘ injective ’ . 2 definition 2 . 6 [ 7 ] let a be a class of c - objects . we say that c is h - cogenerated by a if every c - object is an h - subobject ( x is an h subobject of y if there is some h : x → y , with h ∈ h ) of a product of objects in a . definition 2 . 7 [ 8 ] given a category c of sets with structures , an object s of c is called a sierpinski objectBRorder in α , a correction to the projected_distance to the shower_axis r , of ∆ r / r = tan ( α ) tan ( θ ) . for zenith_angles below 45 ◦ , and for the longest distances in our dataset of about 500 m , this could introduce a timing uncertainty ( scatter ) of at_most 0 . 5 ns at the largest distances ( or 0 . 3 ns for typical zenith_angles around 30 degrees ) . this is comparable to the calibration_uncertainty between lofar station ’_s clocks ( see_sect . 3 . 2 ) . a possible bias from an asymmetric antenna layout would_be no larger_than 2 % on the estimated angle α and would not change the best - fitted shape . therefore , for the purpose of this analysis we apply the shower - plane projection , noting_that in a detailed_comparison with simulations , and for very_large and / or inclined air_showers , a two - dimensional fitting_procedure may be favored . 4 . 3 . fitting the wavefront shape various wavefront shapes have_been_proposed ; we test a conical and spherical_shape , such as argued for in [ 12 ] . we also test a hyperboloid ; this is a natural function with 2 parameters that combines a curved shape for small distances , and a conical_shape for large_distances . the fit functions , for the arrival_time differences with_respect_to a plane_waveBRcost to build complicated , specialized geometries , such as resonant electrode strucutres , for use in cold_atom traps and plasma devices . ii . printed part description in order to test the dimensional tolerances and outgassing properties of printed materials , a cad design for a modified waveguide was printed by shapeways in a variety of different materials using printers developed by eos gmbh . 3 these printers use a technique called selective laser sintering ( sls ) to fuse powdered materials into parts . 4 while the waveguides were ordered from a specific printing service , they are thought to be representative of 3d printed materials by examination of material datasheets from similar sintering printer services that use the same methods . the waveguide was modified to include extra exterior tabs to measure dimensional tolerances of the printing process . printed materials included glass , acrylic , pa12 polyamide , alumide ( polyamide / aluminum powder ) , and sterling silver ( 92 . 5BR. wang , z . wang , z . li , z . wang , z . xiong , z . zhang , the genome of the mesopolyploid crop species brassica rapa . , nat_genet 43 ( 10 ) ( 2011 ) 1035 – 1039 . doi_: 10 . 1038_/ ng . 919 .

( 23 ) . this procedure was repeated for various peak laser_intensities , and the result plotted in fig . 8 . this method demonstrates good_agreement_between the pmpb and nli models over a wide_range of intensities . at the lowest laser_intensities plotted , the ionization_rate is artificially_increased due_to small numerical damping of the bound probability as measured by ρ b ( t ) . at the highest intensities , accuracy is limited by the effect of depletion : at 1x1015 w /_cm2 , the electron is completely_ionized before the end of the pulse . since tfwhm is unchanged , the resulting effective rate is artificially suppressed . pmpb nli 9 tric field . when compared to an ab_initio simulation of atomic_hydrogen , the nli model gives surprisingly accurate results for the bound probability and atomic dipole_moment . the ionization_rate for extended ranges of laser_frequency and intensity were measured by comparing to the pmpb ionization_rate , reproducing results again with surprising accuracy . theBR, α 0 6 = β 0 , such that where { ( qk , ck ) } k has the recursive structure w . r . t .
