between the electromagnetic and strong_interactions [ 5 ] . i ( s , t ) comes_from the strong_interactions , f em i ( s , t ) e ϕ ( s , t ) , where f h i our model is based_on the representation that at high_energies a hadron interaction in the nonperturbative_regime is determined_by the reggenized - gluon_exchange . the cross - even part of this amplitude can have 2 nonperturbative parts , possible standard pomeron - p2np and cross - even part of the 3 - non - perturbative gluons - p3np . the interaction of these two objects is proportional to two different form_factors of the hadron . this is the main assumption of the model . the second important assumption is that we_chose the slope of the second_term 4 times_smaller_than the slope of the first_term , by analogy with the two pomeron cut . both terms have the same intercept . the form_factors are determined_by the general parton_distributions of the hadron ( gpds ) . the first form_factor corresponding to the first momentum of gpds is the standard electromagnetic form_factor - g ( t ) . the second form_factor , determined_by the second momentum of gpds - a ( t ) , corresponds_to the matter distribution of the nucleon [ 6 , 7 , 8 ] . the parameters and t - dependence of the gpds are determined_by the standard parton_distribution_functions , so by the experimental_data on the deep_inelastic_scattering and by the experimental_data for the electromagnetic_form_factors ( see [ 9 ] )BR= p p ( p − 1 ) p x tanhp ( x ) p − 2 coshp ( x ) p UNK x coshp ( x ) p UNK , which is positive because sinhp ( x ) > x and coshp ( x ) > 1 for all x > 0 . thus f ( x ) is strictly_increasing and f ( x ) > f ( 0 ) = 0 , this implies the proof . UNK proof of theorem 1 . 3 . write f ( x ) = f1 ( x ) / f2 ( x ) for x ∈ ( 0 , π p / 2 ) , where f1 ( x ) = log UNK x sinp ( x ) UNK , f2 ( x ) = log UNK sinhp ( x ) x UNK . on the conjecture of generalized trigonometric and hyperbolic functions5 for the proof of the monotonicity of the function f , it is enough to prove that f ′ ( x ) = f ′ 1 ( x ) f2 ( x ) − f1 ( x ) f ′ 2 ( x ) f2 ( x ) 2 is positive . after simple computation , this is equivalent to write x ( f2 ( x ) ) 2 f ′ ( x ) = sinp ( x ) − x cosp ( x ) sinp ( x ) f2 ( x ) − x coshp ( x ) − sinhp ( x ) sinhp (BRall open_subsets of x . a map is a continuous function . 1 for an easier understanding of the paper , it is recommended to study treatises [ 10 ] and [ 6 ] . 2 . measures on sets of tuples of matrices for each n > 1 denote by mn the c ∗ - algebra of all n × n matrices and by un the unitary_group of mn ( with unit i ) . fix k > 1 ( as the length of tuples ) and equip the vector_space m k n of all k - tuples of n × n matrices with the action of un given by u .

composite models [ 19 , 20 ] ; models with z ′ bosons [ 21 – 31 ] ; models with w ′ ( or both ) bosons [ 32 – 38 ] ; models with extra scalars [ 39 – 47 ] . model independent analyses in terms of effective operators also exist [ 48 – 56 ] ; as_well as studies that compare different models and study the implications for observables at lhc [ 57 – 68 ] . a recent comparison of models has found that it is very_hard for simple models ( thoseBReqm 7 computational scheme from the results obtained in the previous_section , a stable computational scheme for evaluating the function eqm numerically satisfactory companion of the function pm emerges : 2 + i τ − − 1 ( x ) ≡ ℜ ne − i π mqm − 1 2 + i τ ( x ) o , a 1 2 + i τ ( x ) when x > 1 , when m = 0 , 1 : using the power_series for the hypergeometric representation given in sect . 4 . 1 . 1 . for x close to 1 and small / moderate_values of τ , compute eqm 2 . for x close to 1 and moderate / large values of τ , compute eqm using the expansion for large τ given in sect . 5 . 1 . 2 + i τ − − 1 ( x ) 1 2 + i τ ( x ) 14 figure 6 : testBR. after the 111in activity had practically decayed out , the x - ray_diffraction off the samples was measured . all samples had a pure cubic c15 laves phase structure . ferromagnetic zrzn2 is crystallized in the cubic c15 lattice structure with zr and zn forming two_sublattices . all sites within each of the sublattices are equivalent . the local symmetry of the zr site is tetrahedral ( the th site symmetry ) , and that of the zn site is noncubic ( the 3m site symmetry ) . this difference in symmetry is instrumental in assigning the probes among two_sublattices . while the tensor of the electric - field gradient ( efg ) is nonzero at the zn sites , it vanishes at all zr sites . consequently , at t > tc a finite electric_quadrupole interaction ( qi ) is expected for 111cd at the zn site and zero at the zr site . thus , the 111cd probe at the zn site experiences both the electric_field_gradient ( efg ) and the magnetic_hyperfine field ( mhf ) , which couple to the nuclear electric_quadrupole ( q = 0 . 83 b ) and the magnetic_dipole ( µ ) moment of the intermediate nuclearBR[ 25 ] . in this_work , we extend the idea of single electron ionization using the relativistic eomcc method to the domain of the double_ionization spectra by considering simultaneous removal of two electrons from the i1 r2 i2 i1 i3 i2 r3 a1 fig . 1 : diagrammatic form of the r2 and r3 operators . lines with down and up arrows denote for the occupied and unoccupied_orbitals , respectively . arrow with circle means a detached occupied_orbital . ¯ fhh + ¯ vhhhh + ¯ vhhhp + ¯ fhp fig . 2 : diagrams_contributing to the 2h block . ¯ vhhph + ¯ fhh + ¯ fpp + ¯ vhhhh + ¯ vhhpp + ¯ w fig . 3 : diagrams_contributing to the 3h - 1p block . closed - shell atomic systems . to the best of our_knowledge , no prior numerical_results are available for the double_ionization spectra of the atomic systems using any variant of the relativistic coupled cluster theory . developmentBRhence promoting organic_chemistry ) more_than a dust free atmosphere . the dust_grains that compose the clouds present a rich catalytic surface conducive to the formation of complex , prebiotic_molecules sourced from the surrounding_environment ( hill &_nuth , 2003 ; charnley et_al . , 2001 ) . in substellar_atmospheres , dust forms at a certain altitude , depleting the local gas_phase species . the dust_particles gravitationally settle , falling to lower_altitudes where they evaporate and are mixed by convective processes which replenish the atmospheric gas ( helling_et_al . , 2008 ; tsuji , 2002 ; allard_et_al . , 2001 ;_burrows_et_al . , 1997 ; marley_et_al . , 2002 ; morley_et_al . , 2012 ) . if regions of the atmospheric gas are ionised the dust will become charged and the surrounding_environment becomes electrically activated , allowing otherwise improbable chemical_reactions . miller and urey were among the first to demonstrate the importance of electrical activation in the synthesis of prebiotic_molecules ( miller , 1953 ; miller & urey , 1959 ) . they considered a planetary_atmosphere rich in h2 , ch4 , nh3 and h2o and successfully synthesised prebiotic amino_acids ( e . g . glycine , alanine , etc ) and other biological_molecules ( e . g . urea , lactic_acid , etc ) when such a gas_mixture participates in an electrical_discharge . amino_acids are critical ingredients for life on earth since they are required for the formation of proteins , peptides and enzymes . a similar yield of amino_acids was also found in experiments carried_out to investigate prebiotic synthesis in steam - rich volcanic_eruptions ( johnson et_al . , 2008 ) . nebular lightning has_also_been postulated as a mechanism for the processing of nebular dust in order to explainBRmore_precisely when their probability_distributions do_not_agree on the allocation of more probability mass to either a majority or minority_class ( eq . 5 ) . the top_layer requires three transformations of the label space . the first label transformation is to adapt for the binary_classifier , that classifies an instance into majority or minority_class . we cluster the labels into majority class and minority_class clusters . because the majority classes are skewed , they can_be b β m1 ξ 1nz1 x y m2 ξ 2 m3 ξ 3z3dz2 5 trivially identified by comparing with the expected optimal balance distribution for each class ( d ¯ y where d is the set of instances and y the set of labels ) . in addition , the two multistage multiclass classifiers with reduced label space help in the decision . while one classifier generates a probability_distribution for the majority class cluster and each minority_class , the other classifier generates a probability_distribution for the minority_class cluster
