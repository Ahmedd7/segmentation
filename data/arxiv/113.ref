( 9 ) the 1d profiles of vanadium , d2o , h2o and pmma reduced using equation ( 9 ) and a detector sensitivity measurement collected at 6 . 8 m are plotted in figure 11 . this new formula eliminates the overcorrection at high scattering_angles ( 2 Œ∏ > 10 ¬∞ ) that is produced by the old solid_angle correction . generally a maximum deviation of less_than 2 % for both vanadium and d2o up to 0 . 8 √• -

triangular part of the cholesky_factors in a vectorized_form . this matrix to vector conversion if done naively can present a significant efficiency bottleneck . to solve this challenge , we_propose a recursive strategy to access blocks of the lower - triangular choelsky factor , and convert each block into a vector efficiently ( see_¬ß 4 . 1 for more_details ) . this novel block cholesky vectorization strategy allows_us_to use the blas - 3 based algorithm with only a nominal computational_overhead . note_that the accuracy of the fitted polynomial functions is in direct proportion to the number of exact cholesky_factors we use in the fitting_procedure . however , to maximize the computational benefits of our approximation scheme , we need to minimize the number of exact cholesky factorizations . to resolve this dilemma , we use a multi -
