[ 73 ] which argues that certain compact but non gauge_invariant theories can exhibit deconfined emergent electromagnetism at_low_energies . in a condensed_matter context , apart_from the quantum_spin_ice state of the pyrochlore xxz_model , a u ( 1 ) liquid is expected also for the partially magnetized pyrochlore magnet with three of the four tetrahedral sublattice spins_pointing along an applied field and the remaining spins anti - aligned_along the field106 , 107 . the resultingBRis constant except that a slightly increase in the density of lane in the exit in the various value of α . on the other word , in the exit of left lanes , the curves never_intersect each_other and arrange in ascending_order of α with it increasing . and the distance_between the two curves are getting_closer , from bottom to top . fig . 4 . average overall density_profile in the right lane for the change of β , when the α is , l = 400 UNK 1 . 0 = α . constant . the parameters are left = ω 1 , ω right = 0 from figure 2 and figure 3 , we can see that in the experiment when the α ( or β ) is constant and β ( or α ) changes in isometric , the distance the two curves show the density changes regularity . when the α is constant and β changes in isometric , the distance_between the curves are getting_closer , from top to bottom in the right lane . when the β is constant and α changes in isometric , the distance_between the curves are getting_closer , from bottom to top in the right lane ; in the left lane the distance_between the curves are getting_closer , from bottom to top ,BR1 ≤ c kh0k ↔ s kf τ − g τ k1 d τ UNK UNK UNK UNK = : δ ( t , s ) ( 1 + kxk ) , = 2 UNK UNK UNK δ ( t , s ) h0 − h0 UNK UNK UNK 1 . δ ( t , s ) t , s − h0 ◦ ϕ g and the lemma follows . 16 4 . 4 the law of large_numbers definition 4 . 3 . for any m ∈ n , any x ∈ r6n and any g , h ∈ l1 ( r6n → r ) with kgk1 = 1 and khk ∞ ≤ ∞ let d ( x , g , h ) be given by lemma 4 . 7 . for any g , h ∈ l1 ( r6n → r ) with kgk1 = 1 and khk ∞ ≤ ∞ , any κBR321 ; i . e . those with a negative_thermal_expansion ( nte ) coefficient 322 , following the discovery that cubic zrw2o8 contracts over a temperature_range in excess of 1000 k 323 , 324 . nte also happens to diamond , silicon , and germanium at very_low temperature ( < 100 k ) 325 and , at_room_temperature , glasses in the titania - silica family , kevlar , carbon_fibers , anisotropic invar fe - ni_alloys , and certain molecular networks at_room_temperature . nte materials can_be combined with others demonstrating a positive thermal_expansion_coefficient to fabricate composites exhibiting an overall zero thermal_expansion ( zte ) . zte materials are useful because_they do_not_undergo thermal shock on rapid heating or cooling . various mechanisms explained the nte in compounds . models include transverse thermal_vibrations of bridging_oxygen in the m - o - m linkages 326 in zrw2o8 , hfw2o8 , the sc2w3o12 , alpo4 - 17 , and faujasite sio2 327 . the phonon_modes ( centered_around 30 mev or 3200 cm - 1 ) 328 , can propagate without distortions of the wo4 tetrahedron and zro6 octahedra , which is called ' rigid unit mode ' . the rigid - unit mode also accounts_for the weak effect of the 430 k structural_phase_transition on the nte 329 . the understanding of the nte for water - ice may extend to the nte in general . the nte of graphite 330 , graphene_oxide paper 331 , zrwo3 323 , 324 , shares the same feature of water at freezing , see figure 52BR) as α →_∞ UNK ∞ α 0 dx β ( α ) = ∞ and thus a landau_pole - free theory . alas , we_do_not_know the real β - function of qed and it is an inherent feature of perturbation_theory with_respect_to the coupling that this integral converges 3 . therefore , any approximation of the running_coupling as a solution of the rg equation ( 5 . 1 ) within this framework is bound to have a pole which , however , we hardly need to remind the reader , leaves the question of a landau_pole of the real theory
