[ 1985 ] ) . the importance of drifts in the propagation of galactic_cosmic_rays ( gcrs ) is well_established and is usually modelled by means of the formulation by jokipii et_al . [ 1977 ] within the framework of the parker transport equation . for solar_energetic_particles ( seps ) , characterised_by energies lower_than gcrs , drift effects are considered to be unimportant . in many instances seps are assumed to be tied to magnetic_field_lines . this assumption is intrinsic within the majority of sep propagation models , starting_from the formulation of the focussed transport equation [ roelof , 1969 ] , and up to modern efforts based_on similar approaches [ e . g . ruffolo [ 1995 ] ; lario et_al .
