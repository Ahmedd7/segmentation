( de / dx ) ion × e is proportional to m and z2 . therefore , by measuring de × e , the charged_particles can_be distinguished and the energy ranges can_be determined . so the space detector system should include both a de sub - detector and an e sub - detector to measure de and e , respectively . when γ - rays passed_through the detector , the interaction_between the γ - rays and the detector could_be due_to the compton effect , the electron pair effect or the photoelectric_effect . the energy_deposited is proportional to the atomic number and the thickness of the detector . however , compared to that of charged_particles , the energy_deposition of the γ - rays was much_lower . thus , to improve the sensitivity response to the γ - rays , cadmium zinc telluride ( czt ) was selected as the detector material . its high sensitivity the monitoring of the γ - rays from the secondary radiation . the γ - rays allowed towards on the basis of the above analysis , three semiconductor sub - detectors were_selected to detect the particles based_on their compact size 5 and superior resolution . figure 6 illustrates the structure of the spaceBR12 to 30 / 06 / 13 . 20 4 . 2 . 2 monitoring the daily evolution of the sr in practice the ability to monitor the sr day by day is very_interesting and provides a good idea of the empirical volatility of such a ratio ( see figure 7 ) . in particular , in an orsa framework it could_be relevant to consider an artificially smoothed sr , for example using a 2 - week moving_average , in order to depict a more consistent solvency indicator . considering the same data as presented in the previous figure we would obtain the following two graphs ( see figure 8 ) . figure 8 : comparison of the standard approximate sr and of a smoothed approximate sr - monitoring from 30 / 06 / 12 to 30 / 06 /BR. rd , 12 . 38 . aw 1 . introduction walking_technicolor models have_been_introduced to overcome the phenomenological difficulties_faced by the early technicolor formulations [ 1 ] , see [ 2 ] for a recent_review . these models exhibit an approximate scale_invariance over a wide energy range as_well as a proximity to an infrared_fixed_point , where the gauge_coupling is slowly running , or walking . asymptotically_free gauge_theories can_be utilized to mimic these properties , where it is expected that qcd with a large number of chiral_fermion flavours is a viable_candidate . ∗ presented at excited qcd 2014 , 2nd – 8th february_2014 , bjelasnica mountain , sarajevo , bosnia - herzegovina ( 1 ) 2 excitedqcd2014 printed on may 29 , 2014 by linking the green_functions of a quantum field_theory the dysonschwinger framework offers an_appropriate non - perturbative tool to explore a given theory over all energies_ranging_from the deep_infrared to the perturbative_regime . since dses constitute an_infinite set of coupled integral_equations carefully_chosen truncations have to be applied in order to treat the equations numerically . therefore , a comparison with other nonperturbative methods is inevitable at some point in order to fine - tune the truncation and to minimize errors induced by it . once an_appropriate truncation_scheme is established the dyson - schwinger framework is a reliable and robust tool to explore the theory . 2 . the system of coupled dyson - schwinger_equations the central_object in the following investigation is the quark_propagator dse depicted in fig . 1 . intimately_connected isBRg ( b ) } ∈ f for any b ∈ b . let b = { b1 , b2 , . . . , bt } , and let ci = g ( bi ) for all i = 1 , . . . , t . we reorder b1 , b2 , . . . , bt in different_ways . let b ′ t maximizes i = 1 ( s − i ) ( s + 1 t be an ordering such that the corresponding t minimizes the sum t be an ordering such that the corresponding c ′ i } ) ;
