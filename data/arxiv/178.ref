a random_graph with average connectivity k [ 27 , 48 ] . for any k > 2 , the system has a finite - temperature phase_transition into a spin - glass state . to simplify the embedding , a random_graph with gaussian disorder and k = 3 could_be studied , where tc ≈ 0 . 748j . however , to be able_to embed the long - range connections_between the spins , we estimate that o ( n 2 ) qubits might_be needed to embed a system with n spins like in the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick model [ 49 – 51 ] . rescaled chimera systems . — it is plausible that if the ratio of interactions within the cells and between the cells changes proportional to the system size , a meanfield - like finite - temperature spin - glass_transition might emerge . for example , the random intercell interactions could_be rescaled with jij → jij / f ( n ) [ where f ( n ) is a nondecreasing_function of the system size ] while_leaving the random intracell interactions untouched . we attempted to weaken the effects of the tightly_bound intercell spin clusters in the chimera_graph by setting the spin - spin interactions to 1 / 4 of all intracell interactions ( on average ) .BRi ∧ . . . } ∧ { o ∧ w ∧ ^ i ∧ . . . } ( 12 ) were written without the associating braces , the two fermions would_be scrambled . in the general case { a ∧ b } ∧ c 6 = a ∧ { b ∧ c } . ( 13 ) association interrupts associativity . s models are modular from the start . the modules are unit q sets with port vectors in the modular grassmann_algebra s . the association of a product of modules of one rank is a module of the next rank that transforms like their product but may enter as a unit into further modules . a spin is a quantum system whose operator algebra is a clifford_algebra . its port vectors or spinors are then the column_vectors ( or minimal left_ideals ) of that algebra . spins of the lorentz_group and isospins are special_cases . according_to so ( 10 ) gut , quark color is another . proposition 2 all quantum sets are spins . proof : for any vector_space v , define theBRan arbitrarily_large value which creates a problem . assuming that the exact values are set to aij = ajk = 1 , the value x is computed as aij ∗ ajk = 1 hence the error for x is x / ( 1 ∗ 1 ) hence x or x ∗ 100_% . for example , for n = 7 , x = 4 . 25 the error is 1 , 170 % . however , x can_be 1 , 000 , 000 % , or more since in section 5 , the proof has_been provided that there is such n for which ci ≤ 0 . 1 hence acceptable . the 10 % threshold , originally set as “ the consistency rule ” in [ 17 ] and later on slightly_decreased for larger n but it does_not_matter for the inequality ( 3 ) in section 5 if it is 10 % or any other fixed value . according the the results in section 5 , there is always such n for which the deviation of the principal_eigenvalue from n is small_enough to consider cp c ( x , nBRproposed a family of ldpc_codes called root - check for block - fading_channels . root - check_codes are able_to achieve the maximum diversity of a block - fading_channel and have a performance near the limit of outage when decoded using the sum product algorithm ( spa ) . root - check_codes are always designed with code rate r = 1 / f , since the singleton_bound determines that this is the highest code rate possible to obtain the maximum diversity order [ 3 ] . li and salehi [ 4 ] proposed the construction of structured root - check ldpc_codes via circulating matrices , i . e . , quasi - cyclic lpdc codes ( qc - ldpc ) . in [ 4 ] the authors have shown that the qc - ldpc_codes are as good as the randomly_generated rootcheck ldpc_codes on block - fading_channels . it is known that the girth , the length of the shortest_cycle in the graph of this code has a significant_effect on the performance of the code . among the algorithms capable of producing high performance ldpc_codesBR( α ω i β ) .
