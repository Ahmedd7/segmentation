fe ( the common tangent shown in fig 1a ) is predicted to occur at a pressure pc of 10 gpa . the paramagnetic α phase is about 10 mry or 1500 k higher in energy , in good correspondence to the curie_temperature of α - fe . in table i we list the resulting lda + dmft equilibrium atomic volumes and bulk_moduli obtained by the fitting of calculated energy - volume data with birch - murnaghan eos [ 36 ] . also shown are gga lattice parameters and bulk_moduli obtained by us and in previous_works , as_well as corresponding experimental values . the lda + dmft dramatically_improves agreement_with the experiment for paramagnetic ǫ - fe for both the volume and bulk_modulus , thus correcting the large overbinding error of gga . the paramagnetic lda + dmft results are still closer to experimental values than the afm gga ones . hence , even by adopting a magnetic state , which is not observed in experiment , one can only partually account for the influence of electronic_correlations within the dft - gga framework . for α - fe we obtain a relatively_small correction to gga , which already reproduces the experimentalBRkarin i . oberg harvard_university volatiles are compounds with low sublimation temperatures , and they make up most of the condensible mass in typical planet - forming environments . they consist of relatively_small , often hydrogenated , molecules based_on the abundant elements carbon , nitrogen and oxygen . volatiles are central to the process of planet_formation , forming the backbone of a rich chemistry that sets the initial_conditions for the formation of planetary_atmospheres , and act as a solid mass reservoir catalyzing the formation of planets and planetesimals . since protostars and planets v , our_understanding of the evolution of volatiles in protoplanetary environments has_grown tremendously . this growth has_been driven by rapid_advances in observations and models of protoplanetary_disks , and by a deepening understanding of the cosmochemistry of the solar_system . indeed , it is only in the past_few_years that representative samples of molecules have_been_discovered in great abundance throughout protoplanetary_disks ( co , h2o , hcn , c2h2 , co2 , hco_+ ) – enoughBR[ 21 ] . we expect that the presented principles will find practical_applications in mri and in particular in medical_imaging , where increased contrast and sensitivity could not only help in the diagnosis but could also reduce the required concentration of commonly_used contrast agents , which could_be beneficial to the patient . methods experimental sample . the relaxation properties of oxygenated blood were approached by solution ( a ) consisting of 90_% d2o , 10 % glycerol and doped with cuso4 with relaxation_times t a 2 = 260 ms ( as determined from cpmg -
