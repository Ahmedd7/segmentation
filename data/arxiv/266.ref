in the future that role will be played mostly by formal considerations . it was after gr was obtained that the intuitions for the new_physics was gained by extracting its implications . however , the question of which portion of gr could have_been anticipated by simple consideration based_on ep have , to our_knowledge , not_been_fully clarified . more_precisely , the questions of the validity of eq . ( 1 ) and whether the derivation einstein gave for it was correct , or which relevant results may be inferred_from it , are not found in the most_widely_used text on the conceptual development of gr . in this_work we_want to point_out that the eq . ( 1 ) is correct ( for negligible pressure ) and that the arguments given by einstein to prove it from the ep are , with some qualifications , correct , being some other assumption that einstein took that led to contradictions . the goals that we pursue are three - fold : from the conceptual point of view we_want to explore how_much can one learn_about a static gravitational_field from simple ( preBRgreen_line represents the model including the black_body , whereas the blue_dashed_line does_not_include a lag from this component . b ) right : simulated lag - energy spectrum for the ionised_reflection model , for the lf , hf and vhf ranges . the red_line_represents the models including the black_body , whereas the blue_dashed_line does_not_include a lag from this component . . black_hole_mass of ∼ 107mbh , this corresponds_to reprocessing within ∼ 20rg of the illuminating source . we consider the lag as a function of energy in three frequency_ranges . the lag - energy data are consistent_with the interpretation above . the lowest frequency lag - energy spectra shows the long_timescale variability has a lag which increases systematically with energy ( fig . 3 ) . this is expected from propagating fluctuations through the accretion_flow , where the disc , soft_excess andBR. 04 0 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 x / l0 2 b ) m µ / n n ( f 9 6 3 0 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 x / l0 fig . 2 .
