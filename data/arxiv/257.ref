. this leads to a puzzle near the endpoint of evaporation : how can the small residual hole have the huge degeneracy required to carry this entanglement ? this was a deep conundrum , but several doubts_about hawking ’_s derivation disguised its seriousness . did hawking implicitly_assuming an over - simplistic behavior for transplankian modes ? can subleading_corrections to hawking ’_s computation cumulate over the long evaporation time , and somehow remove the entanglement problem ? the ‘ theorem ’ it was therefore useful to have hawking ’_s argument recast as a rigorous ‘ theorem ’ [ 2 ] . good slices were used to bypass the transplanckian problem , and the power of strong_subadditivity was used to constrain the impact of small corrections . if ( i ) the evolution of low_energy modes at the horizon is within a fraction ǫ of the semiclassical expectation , and ( iiBR1 ζ 0 , then there_exists λ ∈ c ω , ∞ δ such that h = h + h λ , · i ◦ w verifies m h = 0 and ∂ 2 r h = ∂ 2 r h . also , if h is of order q , then h is of order q . moreover , for all s ∈ n , k λ k δ , s ≤ cs ζ 0 ( ζ 0 ǫ 0 η s + ζ 0 ǫ s + ζ s ǫ 0 ) around the stability of kam - tori 35 and [ h − h ] ρ , δ , s ≤ cs ζ 0 ( ζ 0 ǫ 0 η s + ( ζ 0 ǫ s + ζ s ǫ 0 ) ( η 0 + 1 ) ) . proof . write h ( ϕ , r , c , ω ) as a ( ϕ , c , ω ) + hb ( ϕ , c ,BRlet bi ∈ dci be the branch curve of the covering fi , i = 1 , 2 . the covering fi is given by adding a function wi to the field c ( x ) with wd i = gi , ( gi ) = bi − dci , ci ∼ mkx + α i . according_to theorem 4 , there_exists ψ ∈ kl ( x ) such that ψ ∗ ( α 2 ) = ± α 1 with sign ” plus ” if ψ is holomorphic and sing ” minus ” otherwise . if ψ is antiholomorphic , define an_automorphism ψ ! : div ( x ) → div ( x ) by ψ !
