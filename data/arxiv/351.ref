fermionic_degrees of freedom . however , our analysis has the disadvantage that the spatial_correlations of the order parameter are treated in a mean - field manner . our results for this model appear in sections ii – v . the second model , described in sections vi – viii , has a more complete treatment of spatial fluctuations of the cdw and sc orders , but works instead with an effective model for these bosonic order parameters alone . also , the cdw wavevectors can now be either along the cardinal_directions or the diagonals : so they can also take the experimentally_observed values of ( ± q0 , 0 ) , ( 0 , ± q0 ) . this model for the competing order parameters has an energy functional which is drawn directly from recent_work by hayward et_al . 10 they argued for a non - linear_sigma_model for a 6 - component order parameter : two of the components , UNK ψ , represented d - wave sc , while the remaining four , UNK φ , represented the complex order parameters for cdws along the x andBRhowever , the braided_monoidal setting is somewhat_more_subtle and is the main_focus of this_paper . our_main_tool for replacing braided_monoidal structures by strictly_commutative ones is a refinement of the usual strictification construction used to replace monoidal_categories by strictly monoidal ones , see e . g . [ js93 , section 1 ] . while it is wellknown that this construction cannot_be used to turn braided_monoidal_categories into categories with a strictly_commutative multiplication , we_shall see that it can_be reinterpreted so as to take values in commutative b - category monoids instead . this gives_rise_to the b - category rectification functor φ introduced in section 4 . 14 . in order to obtain an analogous rectification on the space level we apply the results of fiedorowicz - stelzer - vogt [ fv03 , fsv13 ] that show_how to associate braided_monoidal_categories to e2 spaces . our rectification functor φ then applies to these braided_monoidal_categories and we can apply the nerve_functor level - wise to get back_into the category of commutative b - space monoids . it was_pointed_out by stasheff and proved by fiedorowicz [ fie ] and berger [ ber99 ] that the classifying_space of a braided_monoidal small category becomes a double loop space after group completion . as an application of our techniques we show in section 6 how one can very simply define the double delooping : given a braided_monoidal_category a , we apply the rectification functor φ and the level - wise nerve to get a commutative b - space monoid n φ ( a ) . the basic fact ( valid for any commutative_monoid in a braided_monoidal_category whose unit is terminal ) is now that the bar_construction applied toBRfor the information_about composition of deposited_film , the energy dispersive x - ray analysis ( edx ) of the films was_performed in the same tem using 200 kv electron_beam . 3 results and discussion figure 1 shows the morphological_properties of the deposited_films . the tem_images presented in fig . 1 ( a - d ) are taken for different time of deposition under same conditions ( i . e , same ion current measured at qmf , magnetron power , parametersof mass filter etc . ) . the corresponding histograms of the tem_images are shown below them in fig 1 h ( a - d ) . each histogram shows a very_narrow size distribution around 3 to 4 nm with an increase with time of deposition or with surface coverage . at lowest coverage or for 20 min of deposition , distribution is centred_at ∼ 3 nm of diameter which is the selected diameter of theBR. 64 ( 1907 ) 248 - 263 .
