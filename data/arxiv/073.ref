questions may_cause participants fatigue and inattention , resulting in inaccurate answers . in order to gather the high - quality data , the participants may be asked to select just a few of questions ; this leads to a large number of missing values . in the presence of missing values , the factor analysis model can_be estimated by the full information maximum_likelihood ( fiml ) procedure . it is well - known that the fiml method yields a consistent_estimator under the assumption of missing at random ( mar , e . g . , little and rubin 1987 ) , that is , the missingness depends_only on the variables that are observed and not on the missing valuesBR) = d ( d > 0 by a 6 = ∅ ) . given σ > 0 , take y1 and y2 in a such that y1 − y2 ≥ d − σ . on the line_joining y1 and y2 , take y ′ 2 = y1 − y2 + 2 ε . since y1 ∈ a , we have y ′ 2 ∈ a ε , so δ ( a ε ) ≥ d − σ + 2 ε . since σ > 0 is arbitrary , then the thesis follows . 1 ∈ a ε ; similarly , y ′ 1 = ε = y2 − y ′ 2 so that y1 − y ′ 1BRwhere the square_brackets indicate the octahedral_sites . the cation distribution on the tetrahedral and octahedral_sites is characterized_by the degree of inversion x , defined as the fraction of cations b on the tetrahedral_sites or that of cations a on the octahedral_sites . the degree of inversion ranges from 0 ( normal spinel ) to 1 ( inverse spinel ) . b . point - charge spinel lattice we first apply the ce method to the configurational behaviors of cations on a point - charge spinel lattice . here we consider the configurations of cations a and b in the ab2c4 system with the spinel_structure in which the energetics is described only by the electrostatic_interactions among ions . here , ions a , b and c are substituted by point charges of qa = + 2 , qb = + 3 and qc = − 2 , respectively . the unit - cell shape of the point - charge spinel lattice is kept cubic . the lattice constant and internal parameter of the spinel are fixed to 8 a and 0 . 3855 , respectively . the electrostatic_energy ees for a configuration is expressed by ees = qiqj rij , 1 2xi , j ( 5 ) where qi and rij denote the charge of ion i and the distance_between ions i andBR, ( see [ 6 ] ) , where h , s ∈ c , x ∈ r with x 6 = 0 , − 1 , − 2 , ·_·_· . from ( 1 . 5 ) , we have ζ ( h ) q , r ( s , x ) = [ 2 ] r q ∞ xm = 0 UNK m + r − 1 m UNK q ( − qh − j + 1 ) m 1 [ m + x ] s q . using the cauchy residue theorem and laureut series in ( 1 . 5 ) , we obtain the following lemma . lemma 1 . 1 . for n ∈ z ≥ 0 and h ∈ z , we have ζ ( h ) q , r ( − n , x ) = e ( h , r ) n , q ( x ) , ( see [ 6 ] , [ 8 ] ) . in [ 7 ] , the second_author introduced many identities of symmetry for euler and bernoulli_polynomials which are derived_from the p -

order structures in a language with a distinguished unary_predicate p , intended to represent the property of being provable from no assumptions ( that is , the property of being a logical truth in whatever logic we are axiomatizing ) . the intended domain of discourse consists of propositions . the languages we consider include some connectives , such as implication i and negation n . one might also consider adding disjunction o ( “ or ” ) and 2 machine - assisted paraconsistency alama conjunction a ( “ and ” ) . using p and these connectives , one can axiomatize various logics by postulating various formulas as theorems . it is important to reflect on theBRν α m 3 c1 2 t v µ ν = π g µ ν . plh ∇ µ π ∇ ν π UNK π + 2 ∇ α π ∇ α ( ∇ π ) 2 − ∇ ( µ π ∇ ν ) ( ∇ π ) 2i , here the energy -
