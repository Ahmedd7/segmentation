/ faculty in purdue_university from august_2011 to february_2012 . this seven month_period includes several calendar events ( breaks , vacations , . . . etc . ) that take_place during the academic_year . these realtime events usually impact the underlying_graph process to make its characteristics non - stationary and drift from the overall mean . we show_how our framework discovers subsequences that correspond_to these global events without detecting local changes that are due_to diurnal patterns . framework assume_that we have a stream of edges continuously_evolving over time e = { et = ( u , v ) , ∀ tu , v ∈ v } . these edges correspond_to the communications among a set of nodes v . here , we consider the time - varying graph g as a sequence of graphs at each_timestep , denoted_by g = { g1 , . . . , gt , . . . } . models of representation since we cannot know the real lifetime of the relationships_among the nodes in real graphs , we compare two different models for the representation of the relationship lifetime : 1 . discrete model : in this representation , edges are aggregated in non - overlapping discrete windows of size δ t , such that any edge et ′ = ( ui , vj ) that occurs at timeBR′ results in a too_low maximum energy of the electrons . in order to reproduce the observed spectrum , hereafter , we adjust the evolution of e , while the evolution of k ′ is fixed as k ′ ∝ r − 1 for simplicity . n ′ 4 . 1 . simple ssc model figure 6 shows the result obtained from our model with the temporal_evolution of the injection_rate and diffusion_coefficient . the model parameters are γ = 15 , b0 = 0 . 13 g , and w ′ = r0 / γ = 1 . 0 ×_1016_cm . the duration time of the electron_injection and acceleration inj = 2w ′ / c ( end at r = 3r0 ) , which isBRowing_to reduced multiple_scattering , and for high momentum particles because the high - resolution pixel_detector is closer to the ip . another salient_feature is a better k 0 s reconstruction_efficiency ( about 30 % more ) because of a larger volume covered_by the vxd system . the pid device will comprise a time - of - propagation ( top ) counter in the central 4 part and a ring imaging_cherenkov system with a focusing aerogel radiator ( arich ) in the forward region of the spectrometer . the top with quartz radiator bars yields two - dimensional information from a cherenkov_ring image based_on the time of arrival and impact position of cherenkov_photons . at a given momentum , the slower kaon ( refer to the right_plot in fig . 2 ) emitsBRUNK v0 , v1 , . . . , vn UNK , where v0 = ∞ and n UNK 2 , be the path of convergents of the rosen_continued_fraction [ b1 , . . . , bn ] q . then φ ( vi − 2 , vi − 1 , vi ) = bi for i = 2 , . . . , n . geodesic_rosen_continued fractions 11 proof . since φ is invariant_under the element s1 ·_·_· si − 1 of γ q , we see that φ ( vi − 2 , vi − 1 , vi ) = φ ( s1 ·_·_· si − 2 ( ∞ ) , s1 ·_·_· si − 1 ( ∞ ) , s1 ·_·_· si ( ∞ ) ) i − 1 ( ∞ ) , ∞ , si ( ∞ ) ) = φ ( s − 1 = φ ( 0 , ∞ , bi λ q ) = bi . UNK 3 . the nearest - integer algorithm one way to obtain a rosen_continued_fraction expansion of a real number is to apply an algorithm known as the nearest - integer algorithm , which was referred to in the introduction . it is much the same asBR. therefore , our analytical_treatment gives a sufficient but not a necessary_condition for global_cascades to occur , and gives only an_upper_bound on the stability of the banking_system . we will see , however , that it is nonetheless a good_approximation , in rough_agreement_with the results of numerical_simulations . it is in principle possible to improve this approximation to account for the non - linearities induced by loops in the branching_process by considering multiple time - step dynamics . this method is commonly_used in dynamical_system theory : the t - th_iteration of the dynamics converts cycles of length t into fixed_points . for instance , to properly treat triplets one can compute a two - step matrix that counts the average number of banks of type i whose failure is triggered by the bankruptcy of a bank of type j within two time_steps of the dynamics . comparing to the example given above , if an initial shock causes j to fail , k will fail after one iteration , and since both j and k have now failed , i will fail in the second time step . while our one - step approximation is already quite_accurate , this approach provides a path for systematically improving the degree of approximation , which deserves_further_investigation . 3 . 2 stability of a given system if we have complete information_about the banking_system , i . e . if we_know the portfolios qba of all the banks and , in addition , the market_impact function for their assets , then we can describe the stability of theBRπ ( q , m ) ( 19 ) π ( q , mh ) = with nh = z ( mh + 2 γ h ) 2 dm 2 × ( mh − 2 γ h ) 2 1 π im UNK m 2 − m2 1 h + im γ h ( m ) UNK . ( 20 ) the contribution from the loops with these unstable particles can thus be_looked_upon as multi - pion effects in π π scattering . it is generally_accepted [ 36 ] that the hadronic gas produced after the transition is in chemical_equilibrium where the chemical_potential of pions for example is zero . chemical_freezeout for an evolving hadronic gas occurs much_earlier_than kinetic_freezeout . the numberchanging inelastic_collisions cease at chemical_freezeout and the total pion number becomes fixed . thereafter only elastic_collisions take_place until the pions actually decouple later at kinetic_freezeout . the pion chemical_potential consequently grows from zero to a maximum at kinetic_freezeout so as to keep the total_number of pions fixed . here the temperature - dependent pion chemical_potential is taken from ref .
