link determinations of a1 ( q2 ) . 5 . comparing form_factors to experiment we fit the correlators for all the axial_form_factors at all values of q2 simultaneously on each ensemble . this allows_us_to use the correlation_matrix between_them in our physical extrapolation . the results in table_iii are taken from fits with 5 exponentials for sets 1 and 2 and 4 exponentials for set 3 . the extrapolation of the form_factors to zero lattice_spacing and physical light_quark_masses is more_complicated_than for meson_masses and decay_constants since we_want to determine the functional_form as a function of q2 . it is convenient to parameterise the form_factors using the z - expansion [ 22 – 24 ] . the conversion from q2 to z is made using the transformation z ( q2 ) = t + − q2 − √ √ t + − q2 + t + − t0 t + − t0 , ( 29 ) UNK UNK where t + = ( mds + m φ ) 2 . we will use t0 = 0 here which means that z = 0 corresponds_to q2 = 0 . the zexpansion maps the line above the real_axis from q2 = ∞ to q2 = t + and then back below the real_axis to ∞ onto the unit_circle . the semileptonic region 0 < q2 < q2 max = t − = ( mds − m φ ) 2 is then mapped to a line inside this circle . the shape of the form_factor can_be described by a power_series in z . as z is small ,BRcoordinates of φ ν ( ξ ) for ν = ( a , a ) , . . . , ( ι ( x1 ) , ι ( x2 ) ) .
