optical system . the transformation from initial_conditions to terminal conditions is a symplectic_transformation given by a single scalar - valued_function , “ by which means optics acquires , as it_seems to me , an uniformity and simplicity in which it has_been hitherto deficient ” ( [ 7 ] , section_iv , paragraph 20 ) . the optical framework explains_why , in the symplectic matrix h = UNK a b c d UNK , the rank of b plays a special_role in the following . the case b = 0 corresponds_to perfect focusing — all the rays from a given position x arrive_at the same position y — and the case det b 6 = 0 corresponds_to no focusing . ( see [ 6 ] for an exposition of symplectic techniques in optics . ) we proceed with the calculations . we recall that graphch = { ( x + i ( ax + b ξ ) , ξ + i ( cx + d ξ ) ) ; ( x , ξ ) ∈ r2n } , taken_over the reals , is an r - lagrangian_subspace of ( cn z × cn ζ , ω c ) , and we note_that π :BRserver receiving a token from each identity provider ) as shown in step 2 of figure 3 . each key server is tasked_with maintaining a public / private keypair associated_with each social_network identity . the key servers contact the identity providers , for example facebook and paypal , to verify the tokens . if verification succeeds , the key server distributes its share of the client ’_s private_key to the client as shown in step 3 of figure 3 . in the case of multiple identity providers , keys are combines as described in section 5 . 2 . 2 . once the client has received all private_key shares , they combine_them to get their overall composite private_key using a key combining function as described in section 5 . 1 . an_alternative_approach to having the client locally run figure 3 : client authenticates with online identity providers software to collectBR/ ) t , e ( l ) m n ( ξ 20 10 0 0 25 20 15 10 5 0 ) 0 g / p y t 0 − 20 − 40 ( a ) nx = 35 0 . 8 ev 0 . 1 ev 20 40 length ( nm ) 60_80_100 ( c ) nx = 35 0 . 8 ev 0 . 1 ev 10 time ( ps ) ( e ) nx = 35 kg negf 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 energy ( ev ) 20 0 . 8 g ( n l ) m n ( ) π 2 ( / ) t , e ( l ) m n ( ξ 30 20 10 0 0 30 20 10 0 ( b ) nx = 65 0 . 8 ev 0 . 1 ev 60 40 length ( nm ) 80 100 20 ( d ) nx = 65 0 . 8 ev 60 40 20 ) a ( ξ 0 . 1 ev 20 time ( ps ) 40 0 − 4BRin energy trading . the power generation in wind_turbines are correlated with the wind_speed which is modeled by a weibull_distribution , and the scale parameters are associated_with strength of the wind and the peak of the wind distribution . a similar mathematical model to predict the output of solar power generation is presented in [ 10 ] , where the output_power is computed by the following three parameters ; efficiency of the photovoltaic ( pv ) system , solar_cell temperature , and the intensity of the solar_radiation . on the other_hand , from system design point of view , models in stochastic network_calculus are successfully integrated inBRgeneralized functions from s ′ d ( r ) , we are always having in mind the interpretation as in 2 . 11 . definition 2 . 12 .
