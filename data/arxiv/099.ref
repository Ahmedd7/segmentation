( 24 ) the classical energy_density in a free space is then t00 = 1 2 ( e2 + b2 ) = 1 ( 25 ) we work in the radiation gauge ( so e = − a and b = ∇ × a ) and write the solutions of the wave_equation with the help of right and left polarization_vectors ǫ ± p , 2 f ∗ · f , ( 18 ) that satisfy the convention p × ǫ ± p = ∓ ip ǫ ± p , ( 26 ) pe ρ ( tBRperformance queries . several resource models are described in literature . a simple model for resources is presented in [ 15 ] . both cpu and memory_consumption of all available robot tasks were measured to reuse them during the generation of resource_constrained plans . the palladio component model ( pcm ) originates_from the field of model - driven software_development [ 24 ] . it contains a resource model for basic performance_evaluation of a software_architecture during design time . the resource model is restricted to basic types such as processor and communication resources . a more_general resource description can_be found in the uml_profile for schedulability , performance , and time provided by the object management group ( omg ) [ 25 ] . this model covers a broader variety of available_resources than pcm . ii . system overview the objective of this section is toBRi + 1 and pi playing the roles of j and p . finally , ru ( p ) is a non - empty euler_tour , so p contains_at_least one endpoint in wi + 1 . thus pi contains_at_least one endpoint in wi + 1 by ( α i ) . therefore we can apply_lemma 7 . 7 with wi + 1 , ai + 1 , bi + 1 , pi , ρ playing the roles of u , a , b , p , ρ . we thus obtain a path system pi + 1 satisfying lemma 7 . 7 ( α ) – ( γBRin eq .

( ii ) as the e − pht and e − phn interactions become_comparable , energy is transferred from the photons to the phonons , mediated_by excitation of electrons from the dhomo toBRcase of kopnin force_acting_on continuous vortex skyrmion ka = p ( a ) , the momentum of the weyl point ; kb = kc = q , the effective electric_charge of fermions living in the vicinity of the weyl_points , q = ± 1 . trum . close to the weyl_points , quasiparticles behave_as relativistic massless chiral_fermions interacting with effective gravitational and gauge_fields [ 25 ] . since the chiral_anomaly originates_from the spectral flow through the weyl_points , and near the weyl_points the quasiparticles are relativistic , they experience the gauge and gravitational_anomalies exactly in the same_manner_as elementary_particles in relativistic_quantum_field_theories . the gauge_anomaly is described by one - loop triangle feynman_diagram in fig . 3 , in which fermion is interacting with three gauge_fields . these fields can_be equal or different , so in general the fermions can_be characterized_by charges ka , kb , kc . the charges are conserved , which means that the matrices of charges commute with the green_’_s function . that is why one can introduce the symmetry_protected_topological invariant , which contains the matrices ka , kb , kc : nkakbkc = e α β µ ν 24 π 2 × tr UNK kakbkcz σ ds α g ∂ pBRonly for the purpose of figure_legends ) , and dashed_lines_represent simulation_results . an_external_magnetic_field of 75 g was applied along the nv axis ( q = 0o ) or perpendicular to the nv axis ( q = 90o ) . modulation of the exponential_decay for q = 90o is due_to the 14n_nuclear quadrupolar coupling of the nv_center . the inset_shows the experimental result for the cpmg_pulse sequence with ten p pulses when 4 the magnetic_field is orientated at q = 90o . ii . odesr experiments with the nv_center optically_detected electron spin resonance ( odesr ) was employed to measure the coherence decay of the nv_center using the hahn_echo pulse sequence23 , 29 or the carr - purcellmeiboom - gill ( cpmg ) pulse sequence30 , 31 in the presence of a static_magnetic_field of ~ 75 g , applied_perpendicular to the nv axis . a diamond sample with an estimated nv concentration of ~ 5 ppm and a nitrogen_concentration of < ~ 100 ppm was_mounted on a printed_circuit_board , and a mw field was applied using a small loop ( ~ 1 . 5 mm in diameter ) fabricated on a printed_circuit_board . the mw frequency was matched to the transition frequency between two electron states ( denoted_by y 〉 and z y 〉 in sec . iii ) . the nv_center was optically_excited by a 532y nm laser , and the fluorescence_signal was detected by an avalanche_photo diode . the detailed experimental procedure for odesr is described_elsewhere . 5 , 32 the nv_center in diamond consists of a substitutional_nitrogen_atom at aBRalso can generate two quasi symmetric samples with_respect_to the median deviation . we named this set of four samples super symmetric samples ( supsys - samples ) . they allow for completely baseline free update_rules , not only for the µ update but also for the σ updates . therefore the two symmetric sample pairs are used to update µ according_to eq . ( 9 ) . σ is updated in a similar_way by using the mean reward of each symmetric sample pair , there r + + is the mean reward of the original symmetric sample pair and r − − is the mean reward of the mirrored sample pair . the supsys update_rule for the σ update is given by : i − σ 2 σ i ( r + + − r − − ) α  2 i UNK ∆ σ i = 2 .
