defective_item is usually 0 , while for defective_items it is strictly_positive . therefore , by running sufficiently_many tests , with high_probability we are able_to distinguish_between the scores of non - defective_items ( which have mean 0 ) and the scores of defective_items ( which have a large positive mean ) . to analyze the performance of score - based schemes , we need to estimate the probabilities that ( a ) a non - defective_item is still marked as defective , and ( b ) a defective_item is not marked as defective . to do this , first note_that for each item j , the scores for each test i are independently and identically_distributed . for convenience , let_us_introduce the following notations for the mean and variance of the scores of non - defective_items and defective_items for each test . below , we_omit subscripts i on y , and we use x ( x ) to denote the symbol xj , i for non - defectives ( defectives ) .BRmagnetic_imager ( hmi ; schou & larson 2011 ) onboard sdo , with a cadence of ∼ 45 s and a sampling of 0 ′ ′ . 5 pixel − 1 . the observations from the large angle and spectrometric_coronagraph ( lasco ) experiment on board the solar and heliospheric_observatory ( soho ; brueckner et_al . 1995 ) are also used to view the associated cme . 3 . results 3 . 1 . overview of the four homologous flux_ropes figure 1 demonstrates the generally similar morphology and the identical location of the four homologous flux_ropes . the flux_ropes are composed of bright thread - like structures , which warp and interweave together . the first three flux_ropes are observed to appear , rise up and then fade_away in 1 - 2 hours . they are associated_with the activations and failed eruption of filaments . the fourth flux_rope is observed to erupt and then forms a cme with a velocity of about 1200_km s − 1 . it is associated_with the partial eruption of a filament and also an m5 . 0 flare . 3 . 2 . the first three flux_ropes the firstly observed flux_rope occurred on 2013 may 20 and was associated_with the filament_activation . at 09 : 24 : 10 ut , the middle part of the filament was initially disturbed and associated_with euv brightening ( figure 2 ( a ) and animation 1 ) . then the activated bright filament_material separately moved_towards the two ends of the flux_rope . meanwhile , the thread -

poor fluid and a body centered_tetragonal crystal under these conditions ( a . p . hynninen and m . dijkstra , phys . rev . lett . , 94 : 138303 , 2005 ) . instead , however , a steady magnetic_field of this magnitude leaves the suspension kinetically_arrested . to subvert this arrested state , we pulse the magnetic_field on and then off , periodically in time . pulse frequencies , ω , which are high relative to the relaxation_rate of the suspension , are indistinguishable_from steady_state . lower pulse frequencies lead to a increased particle mobility and a microstructure that evolves_towards the state predicted for equilibrium . the transition from disordered monolayer to condensed_phase proceeds due_to a remarkable rayleigh - plateau_instability when the pulse frequency is low . in the video we depict the evolution of the suspension driven by magnetic_fields with four different pulse frequencies . beginning with the pulse frequency , 0 . 66 hz , we observe_that the suspension organizes into dense columns or threads parallel with the magnetic_field_lines . these columns are unstable and their surface deforms sinusoidally . this perturbationBRn1 − n2 ) / 2 , and  j = (  / 2 ) ( n1 + n2 ) = (  / 2 ) n , respectively . for reasons described in detail_below , it_turns_out to be more_convenient to instead express the basis in eigenstates of j , sz , and jz , where the eigenvalues of the last quantity  mz =  ( mj + ms ) = (  / 2 ) ( n1 − n2 ± 1 ) . note_that the only component of the total_angular_momentum operator j that commutes_with heff is jz . thus , the symmetry of the spin space of the hamiltonian is reduced to u ( 1 ) . iii . polariton mapping while the first part of the effective_hamiltonian ( 5 ) indicates that the atoms experience an effective spinorbit_coupling through their interactions with the cavity_modes , the remainder corresponds_to a generalized jaynes - cummings_model . the natural representation of the quasiparticles in the latter model is that of cavity_polaritons ( superpositions of atomic and photonic excitations ) . explicit diagonalization of the full polariton hamiltonian , performed below , shows that in fact it is the dressed pseudospin states that experience the spinorbit interactions and synthetic_magnetic_fields . a . diagonalizing the generalized jaynes - cummings_hamiltonian in order to map the hamiltonian ( 5 ) into the polariton basis , we first exactly diagonalize hgjc . ignoring theBRand the fractional coordinate of o at ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) was changed 0wave vectorfrequency ( thz ) UNK UNK xxmmrr2468101214161815010050elastic modulus ( gpa ) 8642 -

linear isomorphism : bs ( n , n ) ∼ = ψ n , n ( uq ( bsln ) ) ⊕ mt6 = 0 q [ rt , r − t ] . however , this is not an algebra_isomorphism . in theorem 5 . 3 . 5 in [ ddf12 ] deng , du and fu show which relations need to be added in order to get a presentation of the algebrabs ( n , n ) . let_us_first recall a slightly_different presentation obtained by adding two new elements , e ± δ , instead of r ± 1 . this presentation , also due_to deng , du and fu [ ddf12 ] , turns_out_to be easier to categorify . as in [ mt13 ] , we write 1n : = 1 ( 1n ) . recall that the divided_powers are defined by e ( a ) ± i : = ea ± i [ a ] ! , for i = 1 , . . . , n . theorem 2 . 11 .

UNK for u ∈ bdp ( x ) let iu be a closed bounded interval in r that contains the image of u . let y denote the product space y : = yu ∈ bdp ( x ) iu with the tychonoff_topology . the space y can_be thought of as the set of realvalued functions with domain bdp ( x ) . furthermore , y is a compact_hausdorff_space , and a sequence ( xn ) converges to x in y if ( xn ( f ) ) converges to x ( f ) for all f ∈ bdp ( x ) .
