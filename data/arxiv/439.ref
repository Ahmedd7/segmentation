5 k higher_than tc . on the contrary , in the curves of the hall resistivities ρ aba and ρ abc in the superconducting_state there are observed two well pronounced extremes , minimum and maximum . it is natural to relate the tc ( h ) values to the positive deviations of ρ abc from a constant value at t > tc and of ρ aba , from the zero line . here , we will not discuss the reasons for the appearance of a signal of such complicated form in ρ aba and ρ abc at t ≤ tc and its absolute absence in the fluctuation region at t > tc . the ρ aba ( t ) and ρ abc ( t ) curves do_not_depend_on the magnetic_field directions and they are reversible ( zf and zfc curves are the same ) . 3 ) m c ω µ ( c b ρ a ) m c ω µ ( a b ρ a hc hab 0 . 4 0 . 3 0 . 2 0 . 1 0 . 0 -

dimensional heisenberg_chain with alternating antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic next nearest_neighbor_interactions which can_be regarded_as a variant of the sawtooth_chain by using the ccm , the numerical ed and dmrg method . the results disclose that , the long - range collinear neel order is still absent similar to the sawtooth_chain although the j 1 j 2 j 3 chain contains the unfrustrated ferromagnetic_interaction 3j which favors that order . however , different fromBRterms of awareness and privacy . they stated that this “ dual tradeoff is between privacy and awareness , and between awareness and disturbance ” . the more information an auditory_display provides the richer the sonification yet the greater the potential for disturbance , annoyance , and an upset in the balance of the acoustic ecology . gutwin and greenberg [ 3 ] claimed sonification is a tradeoff_between being well informed and being distracted . kilander and lonnqvist noted the effect of such sonifications on people sharing the workspace : “ in a shared environment , one recipient may listen with interest while_others find themselves exposed to an incomprehensible noise ” [ 4 ] . indeed , commenting upon the design of their nomadic radio system1 , sawhney and schmandt [ 5 , 6 ] cautioned that care_must_be_taken to ensure that the auditory_display intrudes minimally on the user ’_s social and physical environment . in dealing_with intrusiveness , pedersen and sokoler [ 7 ] framed the problem as a balance_between putting a low demand on attention versus conveying sufficient information . they studied this problem through an ‘ ecology of awareness ’ thus acknowledging the importance of the acoustic ecology of a sonification . pedersen and sokola made the auditory , visual , and haptic representations of their aroma system highly abstract – abstraction would_allow useful information to 1 in nomadic radio a mixture of ambient sound , recorded voice cues , and summaries of email and text_messages is used to help mobile workers keep_track of information and communication services . lemma 4 : haptic input + auditory_display = musical_instrument ? 3BRvs numpoints figure 13 : figures are for the top off -

[ 84BR) ( 5b ) we note_that bn , k but not γ n , k have_already_been calculated in ref . [ 5 ] . while bn , 1 / bn ≈ 4 . 58 of ref . [ 5 ] is quite_close to our number , the k = 2 resonance with bn , 2 / bn ≈ 1 . 01 was predicted in ref . [ 5 ] to be significantly further from the atom - trimer threshold than our result . in contrast to s - wave , there is no four - boson resonances in higher angular_momentum states as can_be seen in the bottom_panel of fig . 1 . unlike in nuclear_physics , the direct_measurement of the atom - trimer cross_sections in cold_atom_physics experiments is not possible yet . instead , one may be able_to create an ultracold mixture of atoms and excited efimov_trimers in a trap and observe the trimer relaxation , i . e . , the inelastic_collision of an atom and trimer in the n - th excited_state leading to the atom and trimer in the lower - lying n ′ - th state . the kinetic_energy ∆ k ≈ bn ′ released in this process is shared_between the atom and trimer with the ratio 3 : 1 . thus , if bn ′ / 4 is larger_than traping potential , the final - state trimer escapes the trap . assuming that this is the dominating mechanism for the trimer loss , the time_evolution of the density ρ n ( t ) of the n - th excited_state trimers in the trap is given by d ρ n ( t ) dt = − β n ρ a ( t ) ρ n ( t ) , ( 6 ) ρ aBR( k , t ; φ = 0 ) = exp ( − k2d0 3 s as the units of length and time , respectively . the results reported below will be_expressed using σ s and s / d0 σ 2 we begin by analyzing the results in fig . 1 of our brownian_dynamics_simulations for the mean_squared_displacement w ( t ; φ , δ ) of tagged yolk - shell particles , varying the shell volume_fraction φ ≡ π n σ 3 s / 6 and the dynamic asymmetry_parameter δ ≡ d0 y / d0 s . these results will be compared with the mean_squared_displacement w ( hs ) ( t ; φ ) of the corresponding system of empty shells , equivalent in our model to the msd of a brownian hardsphere liquid at volume_fraction φ [ 20 , 21 ] . fig . 1 ( a ) and 1 ( b ) contain , respectively , the results for w ( t ; φ , δ ) at φ = 0 ( freely - diffusing yolk - shells ) and φ = 0 . 4 ( stronglyinteracting yolk - shells ) . fig . 1 ( a ) is intended to illustrate two effects in a simple manner . the first is the effect of yolk - shell interactions , which is illustrated by the comparison of the circles , representing the msdBRicelandic deep - earth basalts present values ranging as high as 37 times the atmospheric value [ 64 ] . 17 table 2 . statistics of 3he / 4he relative to air ( ra ) of basalts from along the global spreading ridge system at a two standard_deviation ( 2  ) confidence_level . adapted from reference [ 65 ] . submarine basalt province propagating lithospheric tears manus basin new rifts continental rifts or narrow oceans south_atlantic seamounts morb em islands north chile rise ridge abandoned islands south chile rise central atlantic islands himu islands abandoned ridges 3he / 4he relative to air ( ra ) 11 . 75  5 . 13 ra 10 . 67  3 . 36 ra 10 . 01  4 . 67 ra 9 . 93  5 . 18 ra 9 . 77  1 . 40 ra 8 . 58  1 . 81 ra 7 . 89  3 . 63 ra 7 . 78  0 . 24 ra 7 . 10  2 . 44 ra 6 . 88  1 .
