( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are clear . ( 2 ) let_us_prove that fz is injective . the only nontrivial case to consider is when d is maximal in ts and d ′ is maximal in tv . then fz ( d ) = fs ( d ) and fz ( d ′ ) = fv ( d ′ ) . since v ∈ n ∗ , fv ( d ′ ) ∈ n . so if fs ( d ) / ∈ n then we are done . assume fs ( d ) ∈ n . let a be the unique minimal node of ts \ n with a ≤ ts d . since fs ( d ) ∈ n , by case 2 in the definition of g , g ( a ) = σ ( d ) . by ( 3 ) in the claim , fv ( g ( a ) ) = fs ( d ) . since d ′ is maximal in tz , it is not in the range of g ; hence d ′ 6 = g ( a ) . so fz ( d ′ ) =BRfig 6 : result of finger extraction using grayscale morphology operators and object analysis [ 12 ] which work for bended finger also , but with a lower accuracy 10 - 20 % . 6 conclusions different applications of hand_gesture_recognition have_been_implemented in different domains from simply game inputs to critical applications . hand_gesture recognitions is the natural to interact_with vision enabled computers and other machines . this_paper primarily_focused_on the study of work done in the area of natural hand_gesture_recognition using computer_vision techniques . we did survey based_on intelligent approaches mainly in the context of soft_computing . approaches using artificial_neural_network , fuzzy_logic , genetic_algorithm and 129 international_journal of computer_science & engineering survey ( ijcses ) vol . 2 , no . 1 , feb 2011 other well performed intelligent techniques have_been_discussed and compared . in appearance based approach , main_focus was on fingertip detection as it was used by mostly researchers . soft_computing provides a way to define things which are not certain but with an approximation that can_be make_sure using learning models and training_data . so soft_computing is very effective in getting the results where the exact positions of hand or fingers are not possible . in the future we will work in the area of individual finger position bending detection and movements , as work done in this area are very_few . mostly researchers worked with full hand position detection or the fingertip position to write virtual words . 7 acknowledgements authors_would_like_to thank director , ceeri pilani for providing research facilities and to the chief , information_processing center , bits pilani and head of department , computer_science , bits pilani for their supportBRorthogonal_matrices 9 x1 x2 y2 y1 figure 2 . choosing points on the torus in pairs so the involution sends xj to yj . following [ 8 , section 1 ] we define for any two unitaries u , v in a c ∗ - algebra a an element e ( u , v ) ∈ m2 ( a ) , such that e ( u , v ) is a projection when u and v commute , and is close to a projection when u and v almost commute . furthermore , we have e ( φ ( u ) , φ ( v ) ) = φ ( 2 ) ( β ) . by [ 17 , example 2 . 21 ] we can find unitary_matrices n = u ∗ n = v ∗ n and v τ un , vn ∈ mdn such that ( un ) , ( vn ) ∈ q mdn are lifts of φ ( u ) and φ ( v ) , and such that u τ n . since φ ( u ) and φ ( v ) commute , we can assume_that un and vn commute as_well as we_would_like . hence , lemma 4 . 2 tells_us_that the bott index of any pair ( un , vn ) is zero . by [ 8 , theorem 4 . 1 ] we then have that the so called k - theory invariant of ( un , vn ) is zero for all n . this implies that for a suitable indicator_function χ , we have that χ ( e ( un , vn ) ) is murray - von_neumann equivalent to the unit of m2 ( mdn ) forBRto flatness , all of them speaking in terms of the lattice of flats . we provide basic knowledge_about matroids and the gammoid class in section 2 . we define and discuss pseudomodularity in section 3 and we connect it with the notion of flatness . in section 4 we define the flatness degree and construct examples of gammoids that attain each of the possible values for flatness degree . finally we_propose some problems in section 5 . 2 matroid_theory background we do_not assume any previous knowledge of matroid_theory , so we review the basic_concepts in this section . proofs and further_insight can_be found in [ 14 ] and , for the specific gammoid class , in [ 3 ] and [ 2 ] . throughout the paper we consider only finite matroids althoughBRof the jth obstacle is the set shadowed in dark in fig . 3 ( a ) . the δ l - extended δ i - hat is obtained via union of the hat with two slightly shadowed disk sectors . in the basic case where δ r = δ r , fig . 3 ( a ) shapes into fig . 3 ( b ) , where ξ r : = vr o / v .
