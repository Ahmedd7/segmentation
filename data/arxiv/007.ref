the model is named_after the respective dependent dynamical_variables other_than the transmembrane_potential . in this terminology , the second generation hhtype models necessary to model sd are ion - conductancebased models . note_that ion - conductance - based models are necessarily ‘ tissue - embedded ’ single cell models because the amount of cell_membrane surface_area per_unit tissue volume , in short , the surface_area - to - volume ratio plays a significant_role . while this factor does_not_affect hh type conductance - based models , in ion - conductancebased models it gives_rise_to the long time scale of sd excitation cycles as compared to much_shorter actions potentials and may likewise cause slow modulations of activity in extended rate - or activity - based neural mass models . with an ion - conductance - based model of a total of 9 dynamical_variables the main_features of sd that happen across the cell_membrane can_be modelled ( see fig . 4b ) . using electroneutrality and further symmetry constraints , ion - conductance - based models can_be further reduced and become amenable for bifurcation and geometrical phase_space analysis . on the other end towards physiologically more_realistic ion - conductancebased models of sd , several_dozens of dynamical_variables in various electrically coupled neural compartments ( ∼ 200 , which effectively multiplies the number of dependent dynamical_variables ) can_be modelled in tissueembedded single cell models39 , 45 – 47 . although in reduced ion - conductance - based models the time course of the dynamic variables can_be to_some_extent distorted as compared to more_realistic models39 , 45 – 47 , main_features of sd are revealed ( fig . 4b ) . two phases and three points stand_out because of their significant mechanistic meaning in sd as an excitation phenomenon : the seizure - like afterdischarges , the subsequentBR2 ( black continuous line ) . which , according_to the typical values considered_here ( see e . g . figure 3 ( c ) ) , induces a change in the wave amplitude of less_than 0 . 01 % . viscous attenuation can clearly not account for the frequency selection shown here , and this will be even_more true in planetary applications where e < 10 − 12 . in the present case , the finite size and the shape of the spherical container are actually responsible_for the selection of preferred frequencies . indeed , using the numerically determined values of the source functions f and g , we can average over z the signal given by the relation ( 4 . 7 ) at a constant r between ( 1 − r ) kr / kz − √ 1 − r2 √ σ 2 UNK UNK g ( ω ) , the boundaries of the sphere z = ± √ UNK ( 1 − r ) kr / kz UNK < ur ( r , ω ) > z ∝ √ erf UNK UNK − erf 1 − r2 , which gives σ 2 where erf is the gauss error function and kr / kz = UNK 4 / ω 2 − 1 ( see eq . 4 . 4 ) . figure 7BR1 . 10 , the nourishing_number of trees , cycles and bipartite_graphs is 2 . a characterisation of strong_iasi graphs was_done in [ 10 ] and [ 14 ] . based_on the results given above , in this_paper , we discuss about the nourishing_number of certain graph classes and graph powers . 2 new results we consider the r - th power of a graph only if r is a positive_integer . now , recall the definition of graph powers . definition 2 . 1 . [ 2 ] the r - th power of a simple graph g is the graph gr whose vertex set is v , two_distinct vertices being adjacent in gr if and only if their distance in g is at_most r . the graph g2 is referred to as the square of g , the graph g3 as the cube of g . the following is an important theorem on graph powers . theorem 2 . 2 .
