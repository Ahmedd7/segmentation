reversal and inversion_symmetries are broken , are energetically_degenerate . the resultBRis the inverse of the operator ( dc + m ) [ 6 , 7 ] , where dc is chiral , i . e . { dc , γ 5 } = 0 [ 8 ] and is expressed in terms of the overlap operator dov as dc = ρ dov 1 − dov / 2 with dov = 1 + γ 5 ǫ ( γ 5dw ( ρ ) ) , ( 10 ) where ǫ is the matrix sign function and dw is the wilson_dirac_operator with a negative mass characterized_by the parameter ρ = 4 − 1 / 2 κ for κ c < κ < 0 . 25 . we set κ = 0 . 2 which corresponds_to ρ = 1 . 5 . in the three -

five chains of 200 000 steps were_carried_out with initial values randomly_drawn_from the joint priors . for the latter , we used uniform or jeffreys distributions for the priors but the stellar density , the teff , and the metallicity , which were described by a normal_distribution . in all cases , the width of the distribution was_chosen large_enough not to bias the posterior . for the transit parameters , epoch , and period , we used batalha_et_al . ( 2013 ) values for the priors . for the parameters related to the host_star we used the values obtained from the spectroscopic_analysis ( sect . 2 . 2 ) . in pastis , the burn - in interval of each of the chains is computed by comparing the mean and standard_deviation of the last 10 % of the chain to preceding fractions until a significant_difference is found . the correlation_length is computed for each of the parameters , and the maximum_value is retained and used to thin the chain so that the samples in the chain are independent . the non - convergence is verified using the gelman and rubin statistics , and only the chains that show no signs of converging are merged_into a single chain . in the case of kepler - 412 system , from the initial 35 chains , 32 passed the gelman and rubin statistics test and were used to make the final merged chain . the burn - in interval was between ∼ 34 to 50_% , and the correlation_lengths for each chain
