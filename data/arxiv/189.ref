[ 18 ] . finally , in [ 23 ] the stochastic4 trial to explain the quantization of the spin projection was presented . 2 . 2 . 2 the joint space of events : thus , in accordance_with the above subsection , the boundary_condition connected with the existence of strictly ( up to the noise in the measuring_devices ; see section 6 . 4 ) two possible spin projections appears , which for a particle with spin  / 2 are on the arbitrary space direction and for the massless photon with spin  on the direction of the propagation . in agreement_with the above note onBRregions and the absence of modification in the λ periodicity confirm the interpretation made above for the xrd_data . for φ > 1 . 5 ×_1013 ions /_cm2 , magnetic imaging becomes impossible due_to the low out - of - plane magnetic_field ( stripes disappearance ) . even if the structural_properties are not strongly modified by the ion_bombardment , the presence of additional seeding defects might perturb the phase_transition and then modify the transition_temperature , the thermal_hysteresis and the giant magnetocaloric_properties . these aspects are investigated by measuring the magnetic_moment , the coercivity and the magnetic_anisotropy of the samples at different_temperatures and magnetic_fields . information_about the coercivityBRalso shows a smaller mass of extremely_fast material moving at 5000_km_s − 1 or more ( smith 2008 ) , which is hard for a se wind model to achive while driving such a large_amount of mass . se winds are still viable for most lbvs , which are less_extreme than η car ’_s 19th_century eruption . as for the extra radiative energy output that initiates the se wind , this is not known . lastly , se winds are assumed to be launched from the surface of the star , but it is also not_yet_clear if the star ’_s interior can remain_stable at γ = 5 for more_than a decade . 4 . 2 . 2 explosions there is growing observational_evidence that some giant lbv_eruptions may be non - terminal hydrodynamic explosions . part of the motivation for this is based_on detailed_study of η_carinae , which has shown several signs that the 1840s eruption had a shock - powered component to it . this includes estimates of the ratio of total ejecta kinetic_energy to the integrated radiated_energy of ek / erad > 3 , which is hard for a radiation - driven_wind to achieve ( although perhaps not impossible with extreme photontiring ;

here we only consider this static equilibrium configuration . depending_on the volume of liquid and the angle δ between the fibers , three_distinct equilibrium shapesBR, electron_paramagnetic_resonance and raman_spectroscopy were_performed . our experiments conclusively show that a ferromagnetic_transition occurs at ∼ 7 . 4 k . ab_initio dft_calculations reveal dominant ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor and weaker antiferromagnetic nextnearest - neighbor spin exchange_interactions along the ribbon chains . the ratio of jnn / jnnn is near - 4 , placing cuas2o4 in close_proximity to a quantum_critical_point in the jnn - jnnn phase_diagram . tmrg simulations used to analyze the magnetic_susceptibility confirm this ratio . single - crystal magnetization_measurements indicate that a magnetic_anisotropy forces the cu2 + spins to lie in an easy plane_perpendicular_to the c - axis . an analysis of the field and temperature_dependent magnetization by modified arrott_plots reveals a 3d - xy critical_behavior . lattice perturbations induced by quasi - hydrostatic_pressure and temperature were mapped via magnetization and raman_spectroscopy . pacs_numbers_:_61 . 50 . ks , 75 . 40 . - s , 75 . 30 . et , 75 . 40 . cx , 75 . 50 . dd , 76 . 30 . - v , 78 . 30 . - j i . introduction low dimensional magnetic cu2 + systems containing cux2 ribbon chains have_attracted a great_deal of attention because of their unusual intrachain nearest - and next - nearest_neighbor spin exchange relations . in such compounds it is frequently found that the spin exchange_interactions_between the cu2 + ( s = 1 / 2 ) ions are such that the next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) exchange is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) , the nearest - neighbor ( nn )BR, x ) ∈ r2n such that , for small t . then the π = { ( 0 , x ) x ∈ rn } , j ( t ) = { ( p , s ( t ) p ) p ∈ rn } , s ( 0 ) = 0 . moreover , if dim γ = k , we split rn = rk ⊕ rn − k , and we write x = ( x1 , x2 ) and p = ( p1 , p2 ) . thus γ = { ( ( 0 , 0 ) , ( x1 , 0 ) ) x1 ∈ rk } , ∠ γ = { ( ( 0 , p2 ) , ( x1 , x2 ) ) p2 , x2 ∈ rn − k , x1 ∈ rk } .
