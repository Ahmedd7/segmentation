( a ) let a ∈ k ( x ) g . the set j : = { d ∈ k [ x ] da ∈ k [ x ] } ⊆ k [ x ] is a nonzero , g - stable ideal . since the g - action on k [ x ] is locally_finite , j contains a nonzero g - module \_{ 0 } , the product q σ ∈ g / g0 σ · c is v . since g0 is unipotent , v g0 nonzero and lies in k [ x ] g ∩ j . this implies that a ∈ quot UNK k [ x ] g UNK . 6 = { 0BRnonlinear bivariate dependency of pricevolume relationships in agricultural commodity_futures markets : a perspective from multifractal_detrended cross - correlation analysis . physica a 390 , 297_– 308 .
