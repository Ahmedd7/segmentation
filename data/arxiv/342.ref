he does find flows that are faster and shorter - lived at_smaller_scales , but the 11 fig . 13 . helen beating sense into george at the banquet . observed flows do_not_agree with the van_ballegooijen ( 2014 ) model . secondly , is flux_emergence ideal or is reconnection necessary ? he often finds that flux loss , cancellations and the deduced electric_fields suggest reconnection is indeed important . thirdly , what is the cause of the changes in photospheric_magnetic_field during_flares ? perhaps a change in magnetic_tension or a relation to sunquakes is involved . in order to solve these_questions properly , higher - resolution observations from solar c and atst are needed , together_with new_ideas and computational_experiments . valentin martinez_pillet ( 2014 ) raised the question : do_you need continuous magnetogram observations for days with very_high_resolution and a small field of view ? he suggested that the answer is yes , but that you also need full - disc observations to provide the context . he discussed an example of the puzzling nature of orphan_penumbrae when sunspots have an unusual appearance ( fig . 12a ) . he suggested that large field of view observations enable an understanding of such localised behaviour . thusBR) can_be used to determine the mean - square_displacement UNK x2 ( t ) UNK , an important transport characteristic . in the case where the process is stationary at long_times , with stationary density ws ( v1 ) = limt1 →_∞ w ( v1 , t1 ) , and if p ( v2 , t2v1 , t1 ) = p ( v2 , t2 − t1v1 , 0 ) , eq .
