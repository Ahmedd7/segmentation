, self - consistent but not variational approaches [ 17 ] have led to the conclusion that a vortex which is thermodynamically_unstable at vanishing temperatures could_be stabilized at finite temperature due_to the presence of a thermal cloud causing the vortex to dissipate_energy and spiral out of the condensate . alongside this spiraling behavior , the vortex_core can become macroscopically_occupied by the thermal cloud [ 37 , 38 , 47 ] . it has_also_been shown that the thermal cloud density acts as a pinning center and causes the opposite sense of precession which is analogous to the violation of the kohn theorem in the hfb theory [ 37 , 47 ] . to restore the proper behavior one must treat the dynamics of the thermal cloud in a consistent fashion ; this is what our tdhfb theory provides . our motivation in theBR13 ) 0 then , w spans the nullspace of the elements of column given by ( 7 ) . 3 . 2 edge operators especially_interesting operators in the space v are the following edge operators that involve only the tetrahedra containing a given edge b . definition 7 . an edge operator for an edge b = ij is any element in v having zero coefficients at xt and ∂ t if t 6 ⊃ b . for a given b , the so defined edge operators are easily shown to form a onedimensional linear space , spanned thus by one of them , let it be denoted db . we will soon ( after theorem 3 ) fix the normalization of db . example 3 . for the edge b = 12 , and in the “ even ” case , any edge operator is , in terms of entries of matrix f ( 13 ) , proportional to ( ϕ 134 ϕ 235 − ϕ 135 ϕ 234 ) ∂ 1245 + ( ϕ 134 ϕ 245 − ϕ 145 ϕ 234 ) ∂ 1235 + ( ϕ 135 ϕ 245 − ϕ 145 ϕ 235 ) ∂ 1234 − ( ϕ 124 ϕ 135 ϕ 245 − ϕ 125 ϕ 134 ϕ 245 − ϕ 124 ϕ 145 ϕ 235 + ϕ 125 ϕ 145 ϕ 234 ) x1245 + ( ϕ 123 ϕ 135 ϕ 245 − ϕ 123 ϕ 145 ϕ 235 − ϕ 125 ϕ 134 ϕ 235 + ϕ 125 ϕ 135 ϕ 234 ) x1235 − ( ϕ 123 ϕ 134 ϕ 245 − ϕ 124 ϕ 134 ϕ 235BR2 and n − 1 , which violates the induction_hypothesis . let now σ be a simplex of ( s , κ ) such that σ ∈ s α . by definition of m , there_exist a vertex v and simplices σ ′ , τ ′ ∈ s ′ ( v ) such that σ = v ∗ σ ′ and m ( σ ) = v ∗ τ ′ . by definition of lower link and s α , it_follows that for every_vertex w in σ ′ or τ ′ , f ( w ) UNK f ( v ) UNK α . hence , m ( σ ) ∈ s α . remark 3 . 6 a variation of partial matching may be obtained by replacing the lower link s ′ ( v ) in algorithm 3 . 2 with the weak lower link defined by s ′ ′ ( v ) = { τ ∈ s v ∗ τ ∈ s ∧ ∀ vertex w ∈ τ , f ( w ) UNK f ( v ) }BRincreased from 26 . 71 + 72 . 54 = 99 to 45 . 72 + 74 . 5 = 120_mev when including vxc ) , and it also somewhat compresses the wave_functions as seen by the differences_between the dash and solid_curves in the figure , which agree_with the observations in ref . 28 . the second example is a gate - induced si quantum_wire structure from ref . 53 . figure 8 shows the schematic_diagram of the simulated 2d structure . for simulation purpose , the device is divided_into quantum and semiclassical regions . the quantum regions include the 15 - nm_thick si quantum and the 4 - nm_thick_sio2 quantum regions denoted in the figure , where the self - consistent s - p solver is applied . the 15 - nm and 4 - nm were_chosen such that the wave_functions are essentially 0 at the boundaries of the quantum and non - quantum regions . the remaining si and sio2 regions are treated_as semiclassical , that is , only the poisson_equation with semiclassical carrier_density is solved at each s - p iteration . the gate vg2 induces sio2 vg1 20BRthe fundamental ideal in the witt_ring whose correforms qn in the n sponding adjoint groups pso ( qn ) are not stably_rational . computations of the requivalence classes of adjoint classical groups by merkurjev are used to show that these groups are not r - trivial . this extends earlier results of merkurjev and gille where the forms considered have non - trivial and trivial discriminants respectively . 1 introduction rationality of varieties of connected linear_algebraic_groups has_been a topic of great_interest . it is well_known that in characteristic 0 every such group variety is rational over the algebraic_closure of its field of definition . however , rationality over the field of definition itself is a more_delicate question and examples of chevalley and serre of non - rational tori and semisimple_groups respectively indicate its subtle nature . platonov ’_s famous example of non - rational groups of the form sl1 ( d ) settled negatively the long_standing question of whether simply - connected almost simple k groups were rational over k , shifting the focus to adjoint groups . platonov himself conjectured ( [ 7 ] , pg 426 ) that adjoint simple algebraic k - groups were rational over any infinite field . some evidence of the veracity of this conjecture is found in [ 2 ] where chernousov establishes that pso ( qBRn log ( n p ) e ( t ) ≤ = o if p = c log ( n ) n the number of iterations is ( 40 ) ( 41 ) ( 42 ) ( 43 ) ( 44 ) ( 45 ) ( 46 ) ( 47 ) UNK UNK UNK pr UNK t ≤ . o UNK n log ( n ) UNK . log ( log ( n ) ) 13 6 expected time complexity in this section we use the results from the previous_section to analyze the expected time complexity of the algorithm in sequential and parallel_implementations . we first prove that the expected_running_time of the algorithm is o on sequential machines . we point_out that if the graph is dense it is advantageous to take a random sparse subgraph of the original graph and perform the algorithm on the sparse subgraph . then , we introduce a parallel_implementation of the algorithm for machines with q processors and a shared_memory . we prove that if q = o ( log ( n ) ) the expected time complexity is o ( n log ( n ) ) . log ( n p ) UNK n log2 ( n ) UNK UNK UNK n log ( n ) 6 . 1 sequential_implementation we now analyze the expected time complexity of the algorithm for random bipartite_graphs from b ( n , p ) on sequential machines . from theorem 10 we_know that the expected number ofBRb ] . then the general solution of ( 4 . 4 ) has the form v2 = q and q v2 0 q UNK q2 , v2 + p v = 0 . q 0 0 ( 4 . 6 ) with UNK x ( n ) and x ( n ) being defined by the recursive_relations g1 = v0 g2 = v0 k = 0 and ∞ UNK λ k UNK x ( 2k ) UNK x ( n ) ≡ x ( n ) ≡ 0 UNK x ( 0 ) ≡ x ( 0 ) ≡ 1 , ∞ UNK k = 0 λ kx ( 2k + 1 ) for n < 0 , v . v . kravchenko , s . m . torba , and u . velasco -
