hamiltonian ( 1 ) is a result of the interplay_between the degeneracy pressure of confined fermions that tends_to expand the region and the 1 / r attraction among_them that causes contraction . a mathematically identical sit2 uation is encountered in the study of the gravitational equilibrium of bodies of large mass [ 3 ] where it is known that there is the chandrasekhar - landau ( cl ) mass limit , beyond which the degeneracy pressure can no_longer prevent gravitational_collapse . the cl mass limit directly_translates_into an expression for the optimal number of terms nc of the qed series as explained_below . the relevance of the semi - relativistic hamiltonian of the form ( 1 ) to the problem of gravitational_collapse was realized by l_´_evy - leblond [ 4 ] whose analysis we now follow . if p is an average momentum of the particle while r is an average_distance_between the particles , in the n ≫ 1 limit the total energy of the interacting system described by the hamiltonian ( 1 ) can_be estimated as respectively . since the energy ( 4 ) is counted with_respect_to that of the particle - free vacuum , the states with n < nc have higher energy than that of the original vacuum and the latter is stable . therefore creation of the electron - positron_pairs is not energetically_favorable until n reaches nc . this is when both 2e0 and r0 vanish with the latter being analogous to gravitational_collapse [ 3 ] . specifically the dependence of the size of the region on the number of particles it contains ( 5 ) parallels the dependence of the radiusBRdensities naturally gives birth to the function rr which plays the role of the detector for the conics qs , t that are isotropic over q . lemma 2 . suppose that the integers s and t satisfy 0 ă s ă t , are coprime , and both equivalent to 1 modulo 8 . then we have ź p σ pps , tq ï r τ ` t3 ´ s3rrpstq , where the implied_constant is absolute . proof . we begin by calculating the p - adic densities for every prime p ‰ 2 , 3 dividing the discriminant of the conic qs , t . the coprimality of s and t ensures_that no two coefficients of the conic are divisible_by p and hence we are allowed to use lemma 1 . p “ st in the case that p divides s3 ´ t3 , we compute that ´ p3tqp ´ 3sq p “ 1 , and hence we are provided with the estimate σ p ps , tq ě r τ ppq . the cases where ps or pt are symmetric and we therefore focus_on p “ s3t the latter . a similar computation yields p “ t4 “ ´ 3s4 alluding to quadratic_reciprocity reveals that the value of the legendre ´ pt3 ´ s3qp ´ 3sq p ¯ equals χ 3 ppq , thereby_yielding theBRcamera at the focal_plane of the telescope , to adopt silicon -

elastic coupling this is the best way to proceed , because thus there is no need to transform the calculated_elastic_constants back to the laboratory system . for these calculations we used the rotation matrices r ( α i , β i , γ i ) where α i , β i , γ i are the euler_angles . following the notation of edmonds [ 14 ] the euler_angles of the rotations from the local systems li to the laboratory system can_be easily obtained and are explicitly given in the appendix ( eq . 21 ) . the rotated hamiltonians , calculated by use of mathematica , have in general complex coefficients . in contrast to the original hamiltonian eq . 1 also operators of the type ol , + j and ol , − j appear . for these more_general cases for which the operators are not listed in [ 10 ] we use the form of the operators given by p . a . lindgard , o . danielsen [ 17 ] . as an i ± j of the resulting hamiltonian example , in the appendix ( eq . 23 ) we list the coefficients bl1 hl1 obtained by rotating eq . 1 with ~ b = 0 from l1 to the laboratory system . in [ 6 ] we calculated the energy_levels of the different ions in a magnetic_field parallel to the cubic [ 110 ] c , [ 100 ] c and [ 111 ] c direction . here in fig . 2 we show the energy_levels for the convenience againBRl ⊂ [ t ] , s ≤ s , l ≤ ℓ and s ∩ l = ∅ there_exists a row number n ∈ [ n ] for which xn ( u ) = 1 for any u ∈ l and xn ( u ′ ) = 0 for any u ′ ∈ s . 5 one can see that for ℓ = 1 this definition coincides_with def . 4 of superimposed s -
