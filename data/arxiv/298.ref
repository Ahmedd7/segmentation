( 2008 ) have shown through mhd_simulations that alignment processes can also appear locally and very_quickly , during the cascade process . in particular , coherent_structures , characterized_by the force - free and the alfv_´_enic states , spontaneously_emerge in turbulence . this may be due_to the fact that the growing time of these inertial_range patterns are comparable to the nonlinear times , which are much_smaller_than the global relaxation_times . although these phenomena have_not_been numerically_investigated in a driven stationary case , there is supporting_evidence that these patches , similar to the situation in ns turbulence , cause a suppression of the strength of the nonlinear interactions . in previous theoretical analogy with studies ( kraichnan & panda 1988 ; servidio_et_al . 2008 ) , we investigate the relaxation principle by computing the probability_distribution functions the cosine - angle ( pdfs ) of cos_θ = f · g f g , ( 4 ) where { f , g } represents one of { v , b } , { v , ω } { j , b } and { j , ω } . note_that the exact beltrami correlations would_be manifested as peaked distributions at cos_θ = ± 1 . the presence of a finite cross and / or magnetic_helicity will to investigate mhd turbulent relaxation summarized by equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) both the fields and their_respective curls are needed . direct observations of vorticity and current_density require volumetric measurements that involve simultaneous_measurements at a minimum of four non - coplanar positions ( dunlop et_al . 2002 ) . this was not possible until the launch of cluster . with cluster data ,BRof nodes including all clusters , and l is the set of graph links . the graph g is an_undirected_graph . there are no links_between the nodes in u or between the nodes in v . all links are constructed between the nodes in u and those in v . let ui ∈ u and vj ∈ v be two nodes in the graph g . if ui is a data instance and vj is the cluster containing ui , then a link exists between ui and vj and the link_between them is weighted with regard to the quality of the base clustering that vj belongs_to . if both ui and vj are clusters , then the link_between them is constructed via the sact measure ( see section 5 ) . formally , the weight of the link_between the nodes ui and vj is defined as follows : ____ α · incai ( p ( vj ) ) , sim sact ( ui , vj ) , 0 , wij = if ui ∈ x , vj ∈ c , ui ∈ vj , if ui ∈ c , vj ∈ c , otherwise . ( 15 ) in the graph g , the instances and the clusters are used as nodes and the relationship_among them is incorporated_into the graph links . also the 13 information among the base_clusterings is exploited to provide a reliability measure for the graph links via the crowd agreement estimation . with regard to the bipartite structure of the graph g , the tcut algorithm [ 38 ] can_be utilized for partitioning the graph into a specific number of disjoint_sets of nodes . the data instances in each ofBRx1 = a0 , x2 = b and x1 = a , x2 = b0 ( the region abde on fig . 1 ) . therefore , the pdf f ( z ) is constant only in the interval z ∈ [ a0 + kb ; a + kb0 ] . ( 3 ) 2 figure 1 : the graphics representation of allowed_region for constructed prn z . in this regard , we_propose accept - reject method to select ( x1 , x2 ) pairs , which form z and lie in the desired interval . the rejected values belong_to intervals x1 < a0 + k ( b − b0 ) and x1 > a − k ( b − b0 ) . in practice , b − b0 ≃ 1 and x1 is discrete with the step k , therefore the rejection area degenerates_into the boundary points of x1 . in this case , acceptreject condition can_be formulated as follows : if x1 = a0 or x1 = a then we drop such values andBR. 2 UNK − 1 = 9 possible edges . graphs of size 0 the empty graph is uniquely_determined_by its size . graphs of size 1 a . { x , a } , aut = h ( b , c ) i , aut = 2 , length of orbit : 6 . b . { a , b } , aut = h ( a , b ) , ( x , y ) i , aut = 4 , length of orbit : 3 . this accounts_for 6 + 3 = 9 = UNK 9 1 UNK graphs . graphs of size 2 a . { x , a } , { x , b } , aut = h ( a , b ) i , aut = 2 , length of orbit : 6 . b . { x , a } , { y , b } , aut = h ( a , b ) ( x , y ) i , aut = 2 , length of orbit : 6 .BRnote_that tv ( β ) is the global maximum of x UNK → rsym v ( tv ( β ) ) ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) .

( 77 ) our results are stated in terms of fv and gv , and depend_on the law of v . however , when ε ( v ) → 0 , interestingly , two different phenomena occur . first , our results can_be stated independently of law of v . second , a phase_transition_occurs for a specific value of the signal - to - noise_ratio β . this is stated formally below using the notion of uniform_convergence introduced in definition 2 . 3 . lemma 6 . 8 . the following limits hold_uniformly overBR( i . e . , a , r0 , r , etc ) are closely_related to the coiled pitch p , and that is mean , the calculations of soi energies for different ps should match different factors . whereas , the variation range of p is so small that we can neglect the differences in the p - dependent factors . figure 3 directly presents a positive_correlation_between the tight - binding soi energies ξ ∗ and the torsion τ with the given parameters above . in stark_contrast to the soi of graphene ( i . e . the order of µ ev ) , the soi ξ ∗ of hccnt has_been notably improved owing_to the effects of curvature and torsion resulting from the structure itself . ) v e m ( * ξ 1 0
