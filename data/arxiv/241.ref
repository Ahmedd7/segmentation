( ii ) ) , each realizable length of f is called a ( resp . oriented ) cayley configuration , and the set of all such configurations is called the ( resp . oriented ) cayley configuration_space of the linkage ( g , ¯ l ) on f , parametrized_by the length of f . the cayley configuration_space is a set of disjoint closed_intervals on the real line . for a 1 - dof tree - decomposable linkage ( g , ¯ l ) , any base non - edge f can_be taken as the cayley non - edge parameter to give a reasonable cayley configuration_space . an important complexity measure of the cayley configuration_space is its cayley complexity , i . e . the algebraic descriptive_complexity of the interval endpoints in the cayley configuration_space [ sitharam et_al . , 2011a ] . specifically , if the endpoints are qrs values , the corresponding linkage is said to have low cayley complexity . we observe_that many commonly_studied mechanisms , including the strandbeest , have low cayley complexity . in sitharam et_al .

[ 16 ] . here we_are_mainly_interested in the transition from composite_fermionization to a tg - bec gas as ga is tuned from zero to large values . the tg - bec gas for nb ≥ na is spatially_separated [ 17 ] . then , the occupation of a single natural orbital for species b is of the order of nb , and it is bose - einstein_condensed in the center of the trap while a occupies the outer_region of the trap . conversely , in the composite_fermionization limit the occupation of a natural orbital for both species is smaller_than na , b , and therefore none of the species is fully bose - einstein_condensed . our_main_goal is to characterize the transition between these two very_different limits as we increase ga . we calculate the ground_state by direct_diagonalization of the hamiltonian after expressing the field operators ψ ( x ) in terms of the single_particle eigenfunctions [ 17 ] . from this we obtain the one - body density_matrix ( obdm ) , ρ 1 = h ψ † ( x ) ψ ( x ′ ) i , and its diagonalization gives the natural_orbitals and their occupation_numbers λ i ( with λ 0 being the largest of them ) . in fig . 1 ( a )BR, − 1 ( n − x ) , ψ s , 4 , 2n − 8 ( x ) = ψ s , 4 , − 2 ( n − x ) , ψ s , 4 , 2n − 7 ( x ) = ψ s , 4 , − 3 ( n − x ) ; but , again , since ψ s , 4 , 2n − 7 ( x ) ( n ) = ψ s , 4 , − 3 ( 0 ) does_not_vanish , we only need ψ s , 4 , 2n − 9 ( x ) and ψ s , 4 , 2n − 8 ( x ) in our application . motivated_byBR( pa = − 45 – + 45 ◦ ) and three other regions of the same radial and azimuthal extent but due east , south , and west ( pa = 45 – 135 , 135 – 225 , and 225 – 315 ◦ , respectively ) . note_that the radial_extent of these regions was limited to 2 . 0 kpc , instead of 2 . 5 kpc , to avoid contaminating emission from the star - forming arc beyond 2 kpc which would_affect the spectra in the southern comparison region . the fact that these spectral regions are at the same distance from the nucleus eliminates any effects that may be due_to the radial_gradient of the hardness_ratio associated_with the wings of the agn component discussed in the previous_section . the four spectra_were binned to at_least 25 counts_per_bin and fitted_simultaneously . we used the same fitting method here as that used for the annular_regions , fitting all four spectra simultaneously . as in § 3 . 2 . 1 , the soft x - ray_emission was modeled using either a single thermal mekal component with fixed kt or a single shock component with fixed kt . the strength of this soft component was left as a free parameter to reflect variations between the various regions , while the flux from the wings ofBR, we are again faced_with a similar challenge as in the discretization step for pdes as there is a huge_variety of ideas and estimators for mesh_adaptation , not just the solution ( 8 ) implemented in the pdetoolbox . 2 . 2 numerical_continuation & pde2path here we_briefly_review the numerical_continuation algorithm used in pde2path [ 103 ] ; for more theoretical background see [ 49 , 74 ] . for numerical_continuation , one views the problem ( 1 ) as a mapping g ( u , µ ) : = − c ∆ u ( x ) + au ( x ) − f ( u ( x ) , x , µ ) = 0 , g : h × r → h , ( 9 ) where we assume , for simplicity , that h is a hilbert_space , e . g . , h = h 1 0 ( ω ) . the goal is to trace out a curve ( or branch ) z ( s ) : = ( u ( s ) , µ ( s ) ) ∈ h × r of solutions to g ( u , µ
