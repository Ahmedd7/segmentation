UNK finally in this section we prove the plancherel_theorem for composition h 2 + fcfs . we have theorem 7 . the composition f ( x ) = UNK h 2 l2 ( r + ) → l2 ( r + ) and 0 UNK 1 √ p pvz f ( x ) = 23 / 2 p + fcfsBR( t ) . just as in the analyses of particle dynamics in dissipative quantum_mechanics [ 4 ] we anticipate that the time - course of α ( t ) may exhibit qualitatively_different_types of behavior depending_on the strength of the non - local terms . in addition , the equivalence to a physical system permits exploitation of powerful techniques_developed in the study of quantum_mechanical_systems with infinite degrees of freedom . in the following we consider the cases of m = 1 and m = 2 and use the rg transformations to consider localization - delocalization transitions . 2 . 2 m = 1 : one true interpretation of data now if α ( t ) differs_from α by a small ∆ α ( t ) we can taylor_expand the kullback - leibler_divergence to give a quadratic distance measure dkl ( α α ) = 1 2 f [ α ( t ) ] ∆ α ( t ) 2 + o ( ∆ α 3 ) , where the metric is the fisher_information f [ α ( t ) ] = z dx 1 ∂BRbecause of ( 11 ) . 4 . if µ ≺ ν and ν ≺ µ we have µ = ν . to see this in dimension one , use the convex function ψ a ( x ) = ( x − a ) + , getting r [ a , ∞ ) ( x − a ) µ ( dx ) = r [ a , ∞ ) ( x − a ) ν ( dx ) . thus µ ( dx ) UNK dt = z ∞ a UNK z [ t , ∞ ) z ∞ a UNK z [ t , ∞ ) ν ( dx ) UNK dt for any a and µ = ν follows . it is easy to pass to higher_dimensions by taking linear forms . 5 examples of strassen convex order : 1 . a classical example is offered by a sequence x1 , . . . , xn , . . . of iid_random_variables of rd having a mean . if µ n is the distribution of x n = 1 n ( x1 + ·_·_· + xn ) then µ n ≺ µ m if 1 ≤ m ≤ n since e ( x mx n ) = x n . for seeing this observe_that j 7 → e ( xjx n ) does_not_depend_on j . this sequence ( µ n ) n ≥ 1 presents an analogy with the dirichlet curve . indeedBRof smooth solutions is also a solution , and thus smooth solutions form [ 17 ] a poisson c ∞ - algebra . as an_aside , remark that an example of a ( 3 + 1 ) - dimensional integrable system possessing a nonisospectral lax_pair that apparently cannot_be transformed_into the form ( 5 ) is provided by the dunajski equation [ 20 ] ; for the examples of nonisospectral lax_pairs in dimension higher_than four see e . g . [ 16 ] . in closing reiterate that the existence of a linear lax_pair ( 5 ) along with ( 1 ) is of paramount_importance as it definitely establishes integrability of the systems ( 3 ) associated_with ( 1 ) . in particular , there is a number of powerful methods for constructing plethora of exact_solutions for these systems using ( 5 ) : the inverse_scattering_transform and the dressing method in their various incarnations , see e . g .
