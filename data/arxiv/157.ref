( 7 ) if the rest - frame sed is known , then one can simply perform the deconvolution by working in fourier_space . indeed , neglecting the position dependence for now , fourier_transforming with_respect_to ln λ , and denoting the conjugate variable as r ( an indicator of spectral_resolution ) and using x to indicate fourier_transformed quantities , we find for the source luminosity density , g ( r ) = i λ ( r ) srest ( r ) . ( 8 ) this is a cosmological analog of the fourier quotient method of stellar_kinematics ( simkin 1974 ; sargent_et_al . 1977 ) . from this form , we see that it is beneficial for the reconstruction of the luminosity density to have a restframe sed with broad support in the fourier_domain . for example , a delta_function in frequency can_be seen to be useful , corresponding to the well - known case of line_emission ( e . g . , 21cm , co or cii ) . however , it is not required that the sed be a single line ; a uniform sed in frequency leads to an inability to reconstruct luminosity density for r 6 = 0 , but any sed with non - trivial structure ( e . g . , a “ break ” , as is commonly_used in photometric_redshift surveys ) will allow the deconvolution to be done . 3 . exploiting angular variations when the emitted spectrum is not known if the normalized rest - frame sed function srest is not known , then it must_be estimated from the same data . in aBR→ r satisfying jx ( h ) = 0 . let g λ = iso ( m , g λ ) be the isometry_group of ( m , g λ ) , which is a finitedimensional lie_group . for each λ ∈ λ , the lie_group g λ acts_on x by leftcomposition g · [ x ] = [ g ◦ x ] . this action is continuous , but not differentiable on all of x . both area λ and vol λ on ( 5 . 1 ) are g λ - invariant functions on x , and hence so is f λ . this invariance
