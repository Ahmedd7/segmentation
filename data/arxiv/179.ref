. in this_paper , we provide a formal approach to modeling trust as a pre - processing step before belief_revision . we emphasize that trust is not simply a relation_between agents ; the trust that one agent has in another is often restricted to a particular domain of expertise . we demonstrate that this form of trust can_be captured_by associating a state - partition with each agent , then relativizing all reports to this state partition before_performing belief_revision . in this manner , we incorporate only the part of a report that falls_under the perceived domain of expertise of the reporting agent . unfortunately , state partitions based_on expertise do_not_allow_us to compare the relative_strength of trust held with_respect_to different agents . to address this problem , we introduce pseudometrics over states to represent differing degrees of trust . this allows_us_to incorporate simultaneous reports from multiple agents in a way that ensures the most trusted reports will be believed . introduction the notion of trust must_be addressed in many agent communication_systems . in this_paper , we consider one isoloated aspect of trust : the manner in which trust impacts the process of belief_revision . some of the most_influential approaches to belief_revision have used the simplifying_assumption that all new information must_be incorporated ; however , this is clearly untrue in cases where information comes_from an_untrusted source . in this_paper , we are concerned_with the manner in which an agent uses an external notion of trust in order to determine_how new information should_be integrated with someBRto understand a complicated process , like the segregation of mixed interstellar_ices however , an_accurate_description of the system is needed . we have therefore studied the adsorption behavior of co2 on two condensed_phases of water , hexagonal_ice and amorphous_solid water . the key_question which is addressed is whether or not co2 shows wetting_behavior on these two different substrates . this behavior will already be indicative of the mechanisms_underlying bulk segregation , which should_be an interesting subject for future_investigations . these can_be performed , if an accurate and computationally_efficient interaction model is available . in this_work , we present a new h2o - co2 pair potential ( pp ) model , based_on accurate ab - initio_calculations of the gasphase complex . the binding_energy of this complex is about_twice_as large as that of the the co2 dimer ( 124 mev 25 versus 60 mev 26 ) , so based purely on gas - phase data , one_would_expect co2 to be a fully wetting molecule on a water surface . of course , the solid water substrate presents a totally_different system and adsorption behavior can_be heavily_influenced_by steric_effects and non - additive interactions 27 . the steric_effects are captured with the pp model , but non - additive interactions are inherently not_included . to investigate these , we perform additional density function theory ( dft ) calculations and evaluate the induced dipole - dipole_interactions . the computational_details are given in section 2 , followed_by a discussion of the results in section 3 . conclusions are drawn in the final section . 2 1 – 11 table 1 parameters for the h2o - co2 buckingham potential . interaction ai j ( ev ) bi j ( ev a − 1 ) h c h o o c o oBRthen p = ap ! hcqi . p ′ ap ?

[ 16 ] finds that the vast_majority of trades executed on sets are between members acting in principal capacity . in analogy to what_has_been_done in ref .
