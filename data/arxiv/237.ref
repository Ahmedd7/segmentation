features of flow networks . first , in flow networks , the level of flow through each_node has consequences for the level of flow through downstream nodes . as an example , imagine a subnetwork of a food_web consisting of strawberries , hares , wolves and foxes , in which the nodes are species , and the links are flows of energy through feeding of one species on another . links can have different relative weights and different absolute levels of flow . for example , although seventy percent of the hares may be eaten_by wolves and thirty percent by foxes , the absolute level of energy passing to the wolves and foxes depends_on the total_number of hares , which in turn depends_on the supply of energy from strawberries . in this toy_example , when the strawberries do poorly , so do the wolves , although they are only indirectly connected . in another example , in an inter - city airline_transportation network , the number of planes leaving a city does_not_exceed 3 the number coming in . similarly , in banking , a firm ’_s outflow of money is ( ultimately ) limited by its inflow . second , maintaining relationships generally entails a cost , so if the absolute flow of energy through a relationship dwindles to a negligible level , the relationship may eventually be broken . if hares become so scarce that it is no_longerBRnj + 1 − nj = d for infinitely_many j . by definition of σ ( α , ζ ) this yields α ζ nj − mj ≤ ζ − ( 1 + ǫ ) nj ζ d · α ζ nj − nj ≤ ζ − ( 1 + ǫ ) ( nj + d ) has solutions ( mj , nj ) ∈ z2 for arbitrarily_large nj . triangular_inequality implies UNK UNK ζ dmj − nj UNK UNK ≤ ζ d α ζ nj − mj + α ζ nj − nj ≤ ζ d − ( 1 + ǫ ) nj + ζ − ( 1 + ǫ ) ( nj + d ) . 28 johannes schleischitz ǫ 2 . since d is fixed for sufficiently_large j clearly ( 67 ) 2 ) nj . λ 1 ( ζ d ) ≥ 1 + thus and recalling mj ∼ ζ nj we_conclude UNK UNK ζ dmj − nj UNK UNK ≤ ζ − ( 1 + ǫ now we distinguish several cases . in case of algebraic ζ 6 = dq p q it_follows ζ d is nonBRd82 ( 2010 ) 014012 , [ arxiv_: 1004 . 0087 ] . s + x decays , phys . rev .
