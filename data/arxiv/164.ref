UNK 7 . the statement of the main_result suppose that λ is a strongly_connected finite k - graph . our_main theorem , theorem 7 . 1 below , describes the kms1 states of c ∗ ( λ ) for the preferred dynamics defined by α t = γ ρ ( λ ) it for all t ∈ r corresponding to r = ln ρ ( λ ) . to see why we_chose this dynamics and inverse_temperature , take r ∈ rk and β ∈ [ 0 , ∞ ) t = γ eitr . suppose that φ is a kms β state for ( c ∗ ( λ ) , α r ) . and let α r be the dynamics α r then corollary 4 . 6 ( b ) implies that β r = ln ρ ( λ ) . so α t = α r β t for all t , and hence the kms β condition for α r is the kms1 condition for α . so φ is a kms1 state for ( c ∗ ( λ ) , α ) . there is a slight subtlety_here when ρ ( λ ) = ( 1 , . . . , 1 ) . the preferred dynamics is then the trivial action , and so the kms1 states described in theorem 7 . 1 are traces , and are kms β states for all other values of βBRis just a module algebra , one can extract a braided system ( h , m ) from the construction of the previous example . studying braided differentials for this system ( cf . section 3 . 7 ) , one_recovers the deformation bicomplex of module algebras , introduced by d . yau in [ yau08 ] . note_that in this example h need not be finite - dimensional . example 3 . 13 . the argument from example 3 . 11 also gives a braiding on the system ( h , m1 , . . . , mr , h ∗ ) for h - yd modules m1 , . . . , mr , a priori without uaa structures . this braiding is obtained by replacing all the σ mi , mi ’_s from corollary 3 . 9 with the trivial ones , σ mi , mi = idmi ⊗ mi . it is denoted_by σ y d . 3 . 5 yetter - drinfel_′_d systems : properties now let_us study several properties of the braiding from corollary 3 . 9 , namely its functoriality and the precision of encoding yd module algebra axioms . proposition 3 . 14 . in the settings of proposition 3 .BRby a bootstrap_argument , and apply the parabolic_regularity theory to get a good estimate of the l3 / 2 - mean oscillations of u and h and prove the main_results . we remark that by using the same method we can get an_alternative proof of kang , kim ’_s results [ 15 ] without using any compactness_argument and our method also provides a different approach than [ 12 ] to prove interior partial_regularity results . it_remains an interesting open_problem whether a similar result can_be obtained for higher_dimensional mhd_equations ( d ≥ 5 for the time - dependent case ) . it_seems to us that four is the highest dimension to which our_approach ( or any existing approach ) applies . in fact , by the embedding theorem l ∞ ( ( 0 , t ) ;
