( 2 ) in physical_systems , the hamiltonian – the function that determines the physical_properties of the spin system , is precisely concerned_with minimization of the system ’_s energy . this physical analogy allows to address the bilateral propensities between the countries as mean of maximization of the countries ’ individual gain ( minimization of their energy ) and as the principal guide in the coalition forming . a major_difference_between the model of spins and the model of rational countries is the long horizon rationality of the countries in contrast to the spins , which are only able_to foresee only the immediate effect of their shifts . countries have the ability to maximize their individual benefits through a series of planned changes while assuming possible losses in the intermediate phase . the ising_model , indeed , can_be represented through the natural model where the countries ’ rationality is limited to observation of an immediate gain , optimizing only their local_maximums . when the most beneficial coalition configurations of different countries do_not_coincide , the maximization of individual gains induces competitions forBRcase di ( ai ) = 2 . first note_that by p ( i − 1 , 1 ) , we have i ) is a convex shedding_sequence for g ′ 1 , . . . , a ′ i . thus p ( i , 3 ) this implies that x ( w ′ ∆ . since x ( a ′ x ( v1v2 ) = x ( w ′ 1v3 ) = x ( v1v3 ) ≥ x ( b1z ρ ( i ) ) , because ∆ ′ is a scaled , translated_copy of 2 ) ≥ x ( z ( w ′ 2 ) ) = x ( b1b2 ) . 1w ′ 1w ′ i ) = ⌊ x ( v3 ) ⌋ , and x ( b1z ρ ( i ) ) and x ( w ′ 1 ) are integers , we also have similarly , we obtain x ( a ′ iw ′ 1a ′ i ) ≥ x ( b1z ρ ( i ) ) = x ( z ( w ′ 1a ′ x ( w ′ 2 ) ≥ x ( z ρ ( i ) b2 ) = x ( z ( a ′ iw ′ i ) ) . 2 ) ) . thus p ( i , 1 ) holds . ε =BR. the lumps spontaneously_break the other linear_combination of the two u ( 1 ) symmetries . on the other_hand , our solutions spontaneously_break the purely space rotation . note_that non - axisymmetric configurations were known before for higher topological_charges in the baby_skyrme_model [ 34 ] , while even one baby_skyrmion is non - axisymmetric in our model . in this regard , our solutions are similar to those in ref . [ 35 ] , in which non - axisymmetric molecular configurations were found in the model with a more_complicated potential . we_would_like to emphasize 4 that our potential is quite_common in anti - ferromagnets and two - component_becs and that it is natural . a closely_related model is a u ( 1 ) gauged supersymmetric cp 1 model where a rotation along the n3 axis is gauged [ 29 ] . the gauge_symmetry induces the potential v = m2n2 3 known as the d - term potential where supersymmetry requires m to coincide_with the gauge_coupling e . inBRfamily of dendrites that includes the types mentioned_previously . specifically , we consider dendrites with diameter d ( x ) = d0 ( 1 + ax ) ν , ( 2 ) where ν , d0 , and a are real constants . note_that different dendritic geometries can_be obtained by changing the parameter ν , for example if ν = 0 , 3 the dendrite geometry is cylindrical , while if ν = 1 the dendrite geometry is conical . first , we show that when ν = 0 the cable equation ( 1 ) is invariant_under the schrodinger group , which is a conformal group , and using the dendrite parameters a representation of the schrodinger_algebra is obtained . second , we show that when ν = 2 the cable equation is equivalent to the schrodinger_equation for the 1 - dimensional free particle , which is invariant_under the schrodinger group . third , we study the cable equation when ν 6 = 0 and ν 6 = 2 , in this case we show that the cable equation isBRthe assumptions of 0 , ∆ π ) ≤ 0 , ∂ u ′ ) that holds by the inductive aslemma 1 . 3 are satisfied . this follows_from the inclusion ∂ π ( u ) ⊂ ∆ π that gives dist ( x ′ dist ( x ′ sumption . this ends the proof of theorem 0 . 2 . 0 , ∂ π ( u ) ) , and from dist ( x ′ 0 , ∂ π ( u ) ) ≤ c dist ( x ′ 1 . 6 . l - regular sets . let y ⊂_rn be subanalytic ,BR2 π ] , nu = 100 for u ∈ [ 0 ; 1 ] and n ω = 80 for e ∈ [ 0 ; 80 ] mev . b . stability_conditions in order to perform the stability_analysis , we linearize the equations of motion [ eq .
