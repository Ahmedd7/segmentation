energy_consumption among the individual nodes . indeed , when there is no cooperation the nodes which are located further from the center are at a disadvantage as the average distance to the rest of the nodes is larger compared to the nodes which are located_near the center , leading to increased energy_consumption for transmission . the introduction of cooperation lessens this imbalance to_some_extent . an_illustration of this effect is shown in fig . 3 . as we can see , the introduction of cooperation balances the amount of energy spent by the individual nodes , and decreases the effect of the network_topology on the individual energy_consumption . fig . 3 . average energy_consumption for nodes at different distances from the center . fig . 4 . average energy_consumption for nodes at different distances from the center . c . scenario 2 : tft and wsls strategy as discussed , in this simulation scenario we start by assuming that in the initial iteration all users are defectors . at the end of the initial iteration we choose one user at random and change its behavior from defector to cooperatorBRν ( x , y ) ac µ ν ( x , y ) [ ¯ ω − 1 ] cd µ ν ( x , y ) α ( z ) + 2 perm .

a substance so perfect as to be in utmost harmony with all the other substances whatever their scale ( whatever their level of recursive nesting , that is ) . the most perfect substance thus ; but a substance nevertheless , hence a concept ( cf . sect . iv - c ) , hence the executor of a “ function ” . to leibniz this function can only be ultimate sort : a “ procedure ” for the optimal scheduling - for - existence of the available concepts . thus god is an ordinateur , or an operating_system if_you_want , who manages a limited process space and selects process images to be deployed and executed onto the bare machine . a task , says leibniz , not dissimilar to that of a player of a board game in which the goal is being_able to “ maximize the returns ” , namely the overall quality , by choosing the best and allocating the most compossible substances to have “ on board ” . god is therefore a sorting_algorithm and his data structures are the substances and the world — in particular its intrinsic_limitations and current state . ultimate sort is written in cu language and is to be executed procedure usort ( s , w ) / * s is the set of all substances * / / * w is a variable reflecting [ 24 ] the stateBRthe lower - case letter ‘ p ’ with numeric values of 10 , 30 , or 50 represents the fraction of primordial_binaries in the model cluster . it is known that many radio_pulsars have large peculiar_velocities attributed to the asymmetric supernova_explosions ( wongwathanarat , janka & m_ü_ller 2013 ) . the empirical kick_velocity distribution obtained from the proper_motion_measurements of young radio_pulsars with ages less_than 3 myr has a peak around a few_hundred_km s − 1 ( hobbs_et_al . 2005 ) . there are also a number of pulsars with transverse_velocities of a thousand km s − 1 , most_notably the hyperfast psr b1508 + 55 ( chatterjee_et_al . 2005 ) . lyne &_lorimer ( 1994 ) and lorimer , bailes & harrison ( 1997 ) showed_that the mean birth velocity of pulsars is 450 − 500_km s − 1 . hansen &_phinney ( 1997 ) found that the velocity distribution could_be represented_by a maxwellian with velocity_dispersion of 190 km s − 1 and mean_value of 250 − 300_km_s − 1 . hartman ( 1997 ) , however , found that there are also many low velocity pulsars as_well as high velocity pulsars . moreover , significant_fraction of pulsars formed in gcs are likely to be associated_with either symmetric or ‘ small - kick ’ explosions ( freire 2013 and references_therein ) . fryer , burrows &_benz ( 1998 ) argued for a bimodal_distribution , roughly 30_per_centBR= l + k , deg a1 = deg a2 = 2l . to show that deg v1 < l is impossible , we just_need to show that deg s1 < 2l + k is impossible . it_suffices_to show that ( it ) 2l + k − 1 = 0 , or_equivalently the hilbert function hf ( r / it , 2l + k − 1 ) = UNK 2l + k + 1 UNK . 2 a special_case of postnikov - shapiro_conjecture 9 recall that , UNK a1 , a2 UNK = UNK yl + 2k , ( x + y ) 2l + 2k UNK : xl + 2k , UNK d1 , d2 UNK = UNK zl + 2k , ( x + z ) 2l + 2k UNK : xl + 2k , i2 = UNK a1 , a2 UNK = UNK ( y + z ) 2l + 2k , ( x + y + z ) 3l UNK : xl + 2k . therefore , we also have i1 = UNK yl + 2k , zl + 2k , (BRphysical states that are not obtained from the action of q on any state ( 26 ) p nti 6 = qu pi . it is obvious that any state that can_be represented as the action of the brst_charge on any other state is a physical state , as it will be annihilated due_to nilpotency of q qp ti = q2u pi = 0 .
