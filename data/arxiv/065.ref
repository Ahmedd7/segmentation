( [ lau77 , thm 3 . 10 ] ) a surface singularity is minimal elliptic if and only if it is gorenstein and dim r1 π ∗ ( ox ) = 1 an important application of the log canonical threshold criterion is the git_stability of the minimal elliptic_singularities . proposition 4 . 11 . let x ⊂ p3 be a surface of degree larger of equal than five with at worst minimal elliptic_singularities , then x is stable . in fact the minimum value reached by the log canonical threshold is 4 5 + 1 180 . proof . in our case , minimal elliptic_singularities are either isolated double points or isolatedBRf , i in a closed_form , we need to sum up all the possibles scattering paths for a quantum particle starting_from xi and arriving_at x f , but it can always be done because the sum in ( 8 ) forms a geometric_series . without_loss of generality , let_us set x f > xi . thus , in fig . 3 is depicted five examples of scattering paths . the first path in fig . 3 ( a ) is the direct propagation from xi to x f , which contributes with eik2 ( x f − xi )BR. fenestration in the leaves of monstera and its bearing on the morphogenesis and colour patterns of leaves . bot . j . linn . soc . 62 : 1 - 16 .

[ 16 ] . in short , cluster_sizes were measured by recording images of contracting actomyosin networks and tracking cluster expansion in reverse time using a customized image analysis algorithm . cluster size distributions were determined for three sample regimes ( controlled by crosslink density ) : many small clusters , clusters with scale - free distributed sizes , and few large clusters . we find that the second regime surprisingly spans a wide_range of experimental parameters and is manifested in a scale - free cluster size distribution : ns ∼ s − τ , ( 1 ) as has_been_observed_experimentally in ref .
