( b ) oxygen_stoichiometry . our raman results shed_light_on the issue of oxygen_stoichiometry , by using information extracted by two oxygen - related raman features , the e2 high peak and the lo band . in particular , we have analyzed the position and width of the e2 high mode to study the local order of the oxygen sub - lattice , as just explained_above , and the intensity ratio i ( lo ) / i ( e2 high ) , which remains well above bulk value of 0 . 75 if the film is sub - stoichiometric . by a suitable combination of these data it is possible to infer if the film has reached stoichiometry or not . ( c ) doping . many variations in the raman_spectra of azo_films with_respect_to zno_films , strictly depending_on the presence of al atoms , have_been_discussed . in particular we_want to underline the suppression of the uv resonance conditions in the case of the conductive compact azo_films deposited at pressure up to 2 pa . this aspect is an indirect_confirmation of energy band - gap enlargement determined_by doping via moss – burstein effect . moreover , the appearance of new so - called anomalous modes in the visible raman_spectra is related to the presence of doping in sub - stoichiometric films , particularly the ones that have shown very_good conductivity properties . 15 in conclusion , all the above observations_suggest a strong_correlation_between raman_spectra and electronic_properties of azo_films , indicating the relevance of a multiwavelength investigation to obtain a complete structural and electronic characterization of thisBRsawicki , t . devillers , s . ga ł e ¸ ski , c . simserides , s . dobkowska , b . faina , a . grois , a . navarro - quezada , k . n . trohidou , j . a . majewski , t . dietl , and a . bonanni : phys . rev . b 85 ( 2012 ) 205204 . 43 ) s . stefanowicz , g . kunert , c . simserides , j . a . majewski , w . stefanowicz , c . kruse , s . figge , t . li , r . jakie_ł a , k . n . trohidou , a . bonanni , d . hommel , m . sawicki , and
