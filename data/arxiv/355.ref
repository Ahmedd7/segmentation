( 2000 ) the above generalizations about shearing do_not_necessarily apply to the densest clouds of the cmz – those which are presumed tidally stable . in such cases , the field geometry would reflect the peculiar dynamical history of the cloud , although shearing that took_place in some of the pre - existing constituents of a dense cloud might still lead to its having a dominant toroidal_field . the field vectors in the dense m0 . 13 - 0 . 08 cloud are roughly parallel to the galactic_plane ( dotson et_al . 2010 ) , and might therefore provide an_illustration of this last point . the dense_clouds m - 0 . 020 . 07 and sgr_b2 , on the other_hand ,BRinclude the name of the tested gene ( s ) clearly_distinguished from the rest of the report ; 2current procedural terminology ( cpt ) codes document the analytical and interpretative procedures that are performed in the laboratory ; 3formalin buffered or not ; 4if the test was_performed without microdissection and / or a low sensitivity method was used ; 5nomenclature according_to hgvs guidelines ; 6example : presence of kras_mutation indicates likely resistance to anti - egfr therapy ; 7examples : recommendations for further testing ; condition of a specimen that may limit the adequacy of testing ; reason_why a specimen was rejected or not processed to completion ; if the report is an amended or addendum report , a description of the changes or updates ; 8reports may be signed electronically 150 jointly by the pathologist and molecular biologist . the pathologist isBRfading tendency could_be traced on the tuorla data , too . in conclusion , based_on the available data , we found that in the first months of 2013 the quasar is in a quiescent phase on both intra - night and long - term time_scales . howard_et_al . ( 2004 ) , analyzing the variability data for four blazars , found evidence that the intra - night variability occurs more_frequently when the flux is changing on longer_time scales . similar claim was made by dultzin - hacyan et_al .
