( 2 ) the hermite_polynomials are at the bottom of a large class of hypergeometric_polynomials to which most of their properties can_be generalized [ 6 ] , [ 11 ] - [ 16 ] . in [ 5 ] , cigler introduced another family of hermite_polynomials_hn ( x , s ) generalizing the physicists and probabilists hermite_polynomials as ∞ xn = 0 hn ( x , s ) n ! tn = ext − s t2 2 ( 3 ) with hn ( x , 1 ) = hn ( x ) and hn ( 2x , 2 ) = hn ( x ) . nomials . in this_work , we deal_with a construction of two new families of q and ( q ; p ) −BRwhere 1 , α ≥ 0 or v ( k ) 1 , α , i . e . , v ( k ) τ is a time scale of relevance in the system . however , as we will see in sec . v , the ability of eqs .

( 5 . 23 ) and ( 5 . 24 ) . we have chosen equal chemical_potentials for both holomorphic and anti - holomorphic sectors ( µ = − ¯ µ ) which results in the cancellation of the linear term in µ , in the same_fashion as in the free_fermion theory . as explained in the discussion below eq . ( 4 . 14 ) this is a consequence of the general fact that one point functions of the spin - three current must_vanish on the plane and therefore , by the tensor transformation_law for primaries , on the n - sheeted_riemann_surface as_well . the result holds also for unequal chemical_potentials as for the free_fermion theory ,BReach layer also connected to the input . the x - axis is the same for all plots . even after many layers , the functions remain_relatively smooth in some regions , while varying rapidly in other regions . compare to standard - connectivity deep gp draws shown in figure 3 . the jacobian of an input - connected deep function is defined by the recurrence UNK j ( 1 : l ) c = j ( l ) UNK . j ( 1 : l − 1 ) c id ( 17 ) where id is a d - dimensional identity_matrix . thus the jacobian of an input - connected deep gp is a product of independent gaussian matrices each with an identity_matrix appended . figure 11 shows that with this architecture , even 50 - layer deep gps have well - behaved singular_value spectra . the pathology examined in this section is an example of the sort of analysis made possible by a well - defined prior on functions . the figures and analysis done in this section could_be done using bayesian neural_networks with finite numbers of nodes , but would_be more_difficult . in particular , care would need to be taken to ensure that the networks do_not produce degenerate mappings due_to saturation of the hidden_units . 10 − 4 − 2024 − 1 . 5 − 1 − 0 . 500 . 511 . 5layer1compostion − 4 − 2024 − 1 . 5 − 1 − 0 . 500 . 511 . 5layer2compostion − 4 − 2024 − 4 − 2024layer5compostion − 4 − 2024 − 2 − 1012layer10compostion UNK 3 connected layers : p UNK f ( 1 : 3 ) c (BR( found by m . kauers ) ( v + 1 ) cm ( v + 1 , i ) = ( i + 1 ) cm ( v , i + 1 ) .
