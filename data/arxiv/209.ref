3g calculations , allows one to obtain a high degree of agreement_with the full periodic ccd and ccsd calculations . one should however keep in mind , that the physical_interpretation of the impurity problem differs_from the true hamiltonian . in the former , the cc ( s ) d method is used to effectively perform a fock_space calculation in the unit_cell with the aid of an entangled bath . on the other_hand , for the full hamiltonian one_considers excitations of the electrons of the entire periodic system . b . 2d and 3d : boron_nitride and diamond in this section , we proceed toBR3 . 20 ) so a black_hole again represents an intermediate state before the separate - universe limit . finally , the overdense_region may collapse before the big_bang ( case d ) , which might_be regarded_as a separate universe in time rather_than space . however , if the collapsing region is just part of a closed universe , it may again virialise at some radius . in this case , it might_conceivably persist through the background big_bang . this possibility is indicated by the broken horizontal_line in fig . 4 ( d ) . however , it is unclear_whether this situation is physically_realistic , which is why there is a question_mark next to this line . 21 fig . 4 : this shows the evolution of the scale_factor for the positive_curvature region and background for k > − 1 / 3 ( cases a to d ) and k < − 1 / 3 ( cases e and f ) with various big_bang times . fig . 5 : as in fig . 3 but allowing for a perturbed big_bang time . the su curves depend_on the big_bang delay in the background universe relative to the positive_curvature region . for k > − 1 / 3 , the solid_line_corresponds_to no delay ( tb = 0 ) and the other lines_correspond to increasing delay . for k < − 1 / 3 , the curves are labelled by η b / π where η is conformal time . 22 tttat ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) tt ( e ) ( f ) ? lmaxhb / cphhhsutb = 0ksu1 . 9991 . 91 . 51 . 21 . 0 iv . separateBR) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) kurucz ( 1999 ) wavelength [ å ] ep [ ev ] log g f ref . 12c16o 15594 . 223 15595 . 946 15597 . 348 15599 . 257 15600 . 737 15602 . 842 15604 . 392 15606 . 702 15608 . 312 15612 . 497 15615 . 250 15616 . 948 15619 . 940 15621 . 663 15624 . 908 15626 .BRthe value of µ we also find that the orbital_period is between 4 -

pf since start of positron operation in 1988 . it had_not_been identified as an electron_cloud effect . kek - pf had suffered very_strong vertical coupled bunch instability . design of kekb completed 1994 - 1995 . the positron_beam instability had to be_solved to complete kekb low_energy ring ( ler ) design . m . izawa , y . sato and t . toyomasu had performed many experiments [ 1 ] and studied a model to solve it . they_showed that a short - range wake gave observed mode spectra . they studied a model , in which electrons trapping by beam under the condition of electron - ion_plasma [ 2 ] . k . ohmi had studied a possible model to explain the supplied instability . continuously ( every passage of bunches ) from the chamber wall , can strong coupled -

air battery capacities . the recent_surge in activity seeking batteries with energy densities surpassing that possible with li - ion intercalation technology is fueled_by the goal of developing massmarket electrification of road transportation . the nonaqueous li - air battery has_attracted the most attention to date because of its very_high theoretical specific energy1 - 2 . in this battery , the net electrochemical_reaction is 2 li + o2 UNK li2o2 , with the forward reaction 2 describing discharge of the battery and the reverse describing charge3 - 8 . the high theoretical specific energy arises_because li metal is used as the anode and ambient_air can act as a source for o2 . at present , there are still substantial technical_obstacles to developing a practical li - air battery9 - 10 . perhaps the most_significant challenges arise_from parasitic chemistry and electrochemistry during battery cycling11 - 18 and the electrical passivation of the cathode that occurs during discharge 19 -
