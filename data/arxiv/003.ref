[ 8 ] ( see also refs . [ 41 , 42 ] ) to study the gamma - ray_emission from the inner_galaxy . we use the term “ inner_galaxy ” to denote the region of the sky that lies_within several_tens of degrees around the galactic_center , excepting the galactic_plane itself ( b < 1 ◦ ) , which we mask in this portion of our analysis . throughout our analysis , we make_use of the pass 7 ( v15 ) reprocessed data taken between august 4 , 2008 and december 5 , 2013 , using only front - converting , ultraclean class events which pass the q2 ctbcore cut as described in sec . iii . we also apply standard cuts to ensure data quality ( zenith_angle < 100 ◦ , instrumental rocking_angle < 52 ◦ ,BRof 158a_gev indium nuclei in collisions with si , ge , sn , w and pb was_studied in ref . [ 15 ] by measuring the cross_sections of production of secondary fragments with specific charge , also known as the charge - changing cross_sections . since neither fragment masses , nor neutrons_emitted from indium nuclei were_identified in ref . [ 15 ] , the measured_cross_sections represented the sum of hadronic fragmentation cross_sections due_to direct overlap of nuclei and fragmentation cross_sections in ultraperipheral_collisions . in contrast to ref . [ 15 ] , mainly the contribution of electromagnetic dissociation was identified in our experiment due_to the detection of forward neutrons from indium nuclei , as explained_below . in this sense our data complement the data_collected in ref . [ 15 ] and provide specific information on electromagnetic_interactions of ultrarelativistic 115in nuclei . 2 2 . neutron emission from indium nuclei in collisions with target_nuclei we consider now the neutron emission from indium nuclei resulting from electromagnetic and hadronic_interactions of these nuclei with various targets . once theoretical_models describing such processes are at_hand , the relations_between the cross_sections of such processes can_be estimated along with energy and angular_distributions of produced neutrons . this helps in estimating the parameters of our experimental_setup whichBRevaluate the shear_viscosity coefficients η ⊥ and η UNK . we finish in section_iv with a discussion of our results . ii . magnetic brane background we consider in the bulk a simple einstein + maxwell system and look for solutions corresponding to the deformation of the ads5 - schwarzchild geometry due_to a u ( 1 ) abelian_gauge_field [ 57 ] . the u ( 1 ) gauge_field is chosen to give a constant and homogeneous magnetic_field . this magnetic_field in the bulk is then taken as an_external_magnetic_field at the boundary gauge_theory [ 57 ] , which is strongly_coupled n = 4 sym . clearly , the adjoint_fermions in sym feel directly the effects of the magnetic_field but , due_to fermion_loops , the gluon_sector is also affected_by the field . this is why the thermodynamic_properties of this “ magnetic ” sym plasma considerably differ_from those found in sym in the absence of external_fields . let_us review this background and its thermodynamic_properties . the action of the 5dimensional gravitational bulk theory is given by the einstein - hilbert_action coupled with a maxwell_field s = 1 16 π g5 r + 12 l2 − f 2 + scs + sgh , ( 1 ) where g5 is the 5 - dimensional gravitational_constant , l is the asymptotic ads5 radius and f is the maxwell_field_strength 2 - form . the terms scs and sgh are the chern - simons and gibbons - hawking terms . the latter is necessary to define a well_posed variational_problem but both the cs and gh terms will not play a role in the calculation of shear_viscosity coefficients2 . other terms are needed in ( 1 ) from the viewpoint of holographic_renormalization 2 we note_that our definition for the
