10 - 3 , nearly two orders greater_than that of mr at low fields . the comparison_between the low - and high - field mr reveals that in addition to the low - field phenomenon related to the yig magnetization_reversal , there is some spin - dependent process occurring at high fields . when additional spins are aligned with high fields , the mr ratio is consequently enhanced . it is interesting that the temperature_dependence of hfmr ( inset of fig . 3a ) is markedly_different_from that of the low - field mr . in ferromagnetic conductors , superimposed_on the ordinary_hall_effect that is linear in h ⊥ , there is a large anomalous_hall_effect ( ahe ) signal that is proportional to the out - ofplane magnetization component [ 14 ] . however , in the low field range ( up to ~ 2 koe ) where the in - plane_magnetization is rotated towards the perpendicular_direction and therefore there should_be an ahe response , we do_not observe any definitive magnetization - related ahe signal . as we ramp_up h ⊥ further , however , an_unambiguous non -
