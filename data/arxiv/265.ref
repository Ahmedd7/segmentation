we observe the same behaviour for small amplitude excited_states γ > 0 ) . while for large amplitudes of the gaussian perturbation , after several_dozens of reflections , the modulus of the scalar_field π ( t , 0 ) starts to grow indicating formation of apparent_horizon , the situation changes when the perturbation becomes small . for slightly_perturbed standing_wave solution , and for simulated time_intervals , the evolution does_not show any sign of instability staying all the time close to the stationary_state . moreover , in contrast to perturbations of the pure_ads space , in this case we do_not observe any scaling with the coordinate time t . here we observe an initially narrow perturbation to bounce fourth and back over the standing_wave solution , which as a time passes tends_to spread_out_over the whole domain . this effect is a consequence of nonresonant spectra of standing_wave_solutions ( 46 , 47 ) , similarly to the minkowski in a cavity model withBRx_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_}_\ x_{_ffff_} 020040060080001020304050ionconcentration \ x_{_ffff_} mm \ x_{_ffff_} outwardcurrent \ x_{_ffff_} a . u . \ x_{_ffff_} like charges stronger [ 56 ] . therefore , if the empty channels are considered as the initial states , and the energy is taken as the reference point , the free_energy difference_between the stabilized structures of the mutant and wild - type channels should_be even larger_than predicted by standard theory . since the attraction force is generally weaker , it may also imply that even_more positive ions than predicted by conventional theory would_be in the stable structure . both possibilities suggest that the b and µ parameters may be higher in reality than in the model system of gordon . to limit the length of discussions , the effect of µ is not systematically presented . just by considering the effect of increasing the value of b , say from 3 to 4 ,BRtwo bands cross each_other . thus , by constructing an interface with pc1 on the one side and pc2 on the other_side , we should see an interface state inside the gap 7 . this is verified in our numerical study of the transmission_spectrum of a system consisted of a slab of pc1 ( with 10 unit_cells ) on the one side and a slab of pc2 ( with 10 unit_cells ) on the other_side embedded in vacuum . fig . 2 ( a ) shows clearly a resonance transmission due_to an interface state around in gap 7 . such a topological_phase_transition represents a classical analog of the ssh_model in electronic systems 6 - 8 although impedance is not usually considered in electrons . the above example is a manifestation of a topological_phase_transition arising_from band_crossing in photonic systems . it should_be pointed_out that the occurrence of the band_crossing shown in fig . 1 ( b ) is by no means accidental . it can_be shown rigorously ( appendix a ) that if the ratio of the optical paths in two slabs of a pc is a rational number , namely , , where , , then band and band will cross at the frequency . at this frequency , and where , so and the gap , will close at the center or boundary of bz depending_on_whether is even or odd . it is easy to see thatBRand so ( 4 ) = ( su ( 2 ) × su ( 2 ) / z2 . hence , the so ( 4 ) theory has two theta - angles , one for each su ( 2 ) , and so ( 4 ) θ 1 , θ 2 + = so ( 4 ) θ 1 , θ 2 + 2 π − = so ( 4 ) θ 1 + 2 π , θ 2 − = so ( 4 ) θ 1 + 2 π , θ 2 + 2 π + . ( 1 . 4 ) for higher values of nc the distinction_between the two so ( nc ) theories cannot_be absorbed in extending the range of θ , and the only way to describe it at the level of the lagrangian is by using the pontryagin square p ( w2 ) . the 4d n = 1 ir duality relates [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 ] an so ( nc ) gauge_theory with nf vectors qi to an so ( nc = nf − nc + 4 ) gauge_theory , with nf vectors qi and elementary gauge 2 m ijqiqj . when either nc or nc are singlet_mesons m ij , and with a superpotential w = 1 2 , 3 , 4 a more_careful discussion is needed . the analysis of [ 5 ] , which took_into_account the global structure3 , identified this duality as spin ( nc ) → so ( nc ) − , so ( nc ) − → spin ( nc ) , so ( nc ) + → so ( nc ) + .
