( 1 ) . our_conclusions are limited to low - beta plasma_turbulence . it would_be interesting to compare the energy partition and frequency broadening at different values of beta and for other initial plasma parameters . we use the constant direction of the global background magnetic_field as the reference direction for our analysis . large - scale fluctuations , however , modify the direction of the background magnetic_field for small - scale fluctuations . this effect leads to part of the frequency broadening in our analysis when the scale separation is large_enough . this part of the broadening results from the different definitions of a local and a global background magnetic_field , which can_be important forBR, when used as a supporting substrate , the films_grown at a polyborazylene_deposition temperature of 400_°_c showed the best potential for improved transport_properties of transferred cvd_graphene , resulting in a 52 % and 151 % increase in mobility compared to cvd_graphene on bare sapphire and sio2_substrates , respectively . the extracted impurity density of < 3x1011cm - 2 for graphene transferred to this sample suggests surface optical_phonon_scattering contributes_significantly to the overall scattering_rate , where h - bn excels compared to high - k dielectrics due_to its high surface optical_phonon_modes . importantly , these results_suggest that even amorphous / turbostratic bn can benefit graphene_electronics . methods hexagonal_boron_nitride is grown on single_crystal al2o3 ( 0001 ) and si ( 111 ) in a 80mm diameter horizontal tube_furnace via a thermal cvd method utilizing a single ammonia borane ( nh3bh3 ) precursor ( sigma - aldrich , part # 682098 ) . the al2o3 and si_substrates are cleaned with acetone , isopropyl_alcohol , and nanostrip 2x prior to growth to remove organic and ionic contaminants . the si_substrates are then placed in a 10 : 1 boe hf solution to remove the native_oxide . solid ammonia borane powder is sublimed at 135_° c and transported into the tube_furnace by anBRthe ball ’_s horizontal acceleration . thus , the most direct way of checking_whether friction turns_off during the first bounce would_be extracting the acceleration data from the first bounce . unfortunately , the bounce happens very_quickly ( 5 - 10 ms ) , so a typical video_camera , making 30_frames_per second ( fps ) , would only yield a few data points ( three in our case ) . in order to make the above method work , one would need a high - speed_camera . this is done in the next_section . suppose , however , that we are stuck with the equipment at_hand . is there any way of checking the hypothesis ? imagine that we have a means of measuring the ball ’_s horizontal_velocity and angular_speed after the first bounce . if we find that they satisfy ( 2 ) , given the fact that they_did_not before the first bounce , that would support the hypothesis . while obtaining the horizontal_velocity is straighforward , measuring angular_speed is not easy . that would_require a finely_tuned adjustment such that the plane of the ball ’_s trajectory coincides_with its plane of rotation and remains perpendicular to the camera ’_s line of sight . furthermore there should_be a clear mark that would stay on the rim of the ball throughout a substantial time period after the first bounce . nevertheless , these_difficulties can_be overcome and such an experiment can_be realized with a reasonable_accuracyBR, each lesson can_be represented using a set of < t , cl , s > tuples which have to be met at the same time . in other_words a lesson can_be defined by the following definition : eq . 1 there are two_kinds of lessons : simple lessons and blocks . in simple lessons , which are the common case , a single teacher teaches a single subject to a class . in contrast , in a block several teachers teach several courses to several classes . in other_words , a block consists of several lessons which have to be scheduled at the same time . there are two special_kinds of bocks in iranian high_schools known as half - switch and double - lesson . in half - switch , two teachers teach to two classes in first half of period and switch their classes in the second half . in doublelessons a teacher teaches a single lesson to two or more classes at the same period . fig . 1 depicts sample of these two_kinds of blocks . class1 class2 language geography geography language ( a ) class1 class2 chemistry ( b ) fig 1 : types of blocks in iranian schools ; ( a ) half - switch , where class 1 has language course in first half and geography in the second half of the period and class 2 is vice - versa ( b ) double - lessons , where class 1 and class 2 students has chemistry with a single teacher at the same time . 22 international_journal of computer_science &_information_technology ( ijcsit ) vol 5 , no 4 , august_2013 the problem can_be described as a constraint_satisfaction_problem , where lessons of a set of courses should_be scheduled into a weeklyBRand time ) with_respect_to the coupling_strength  , for the case of both local and global link rewiring . it can_be clearly_seen that as the connection network becomes_more dynamic , the range of complete syncronization increases . furthermore , for both the connection rewiring scenarios the qualitative results are similar . 3 now , we consider the scenario where link changes are infrequent , namely a network near the static limit , with pt close to zero . here one_obtains a range of critical coupling_strengths , with  sync being strongly_dependent_on the initial confguration of links . a deeper_understanding is gained by studying the distribution of  sync , at fixed pt and ps , for different initial realizations , as displayed for representative cases in fig . 3 . it is clearly_seen from the numerics that when we are closer to the static limit there is a spread in values of  sync .BR- symmetry † . using ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) it can_be shown that provided all the material_bodies move with a speed lower_than the corresponding cherenkov_emission threshold in the considered reference_frame , i . e . provided ( ) v z < ( ) c n z / , the material matrix is clh † alternatively , we could define this matrix m is positive_definite . − u m f . clh is hermitian with_respect_to the canonical inner_product provided the real - symmetric material u with = ∂ u i m so that h m n = = 1 / 2 1 / 2 1 / 2 cl ⋅_⋅_⋅_⋅ − t - 11positive definite [ 12 , 46 ] . note_that f f = ∫ in the system . d w 3 r em p , is the total wave energy stored most dramatically , when the speed of at_least_one of the material_bodies exceeds the associated cherenkov_emission threshold ( v i > c n / i ) the material matrix m becomes indefinite . in such a case ( 16 ) defines an indefinite_inner_product , and the property f 2 h f 1 cl h = cl f f does_not_guarantee the reality of the spectrum of 2 1 clh , and optical instabilities may_occur [ 12 ] . therefore , the spontaneous_symmetry_breaking of the system requires that the speed of one or more material_bodies exceeds the cherenkov_emission threshold . iv . spontaneous_symmetry_breaking for aBR, we obtain x ∈ s ( m ) thus x ∈ r15 ∩ s ( m ) . then , if σ ∈ sing ( x ) ∩ cl ( psaddled ( x ) ) , cl ( w u ( σ ) ) is singularhyperbolic for x ( if ind ( σ ) = 2 ) and that cl ( w s ( σ ) ) is a singular - hyperbolic_attractor for − x ( if ind ( σ ) = 1 ) . now we observe_that if p ∈ psaddled ( x ) then h ( p ) ⊂ cl ( saddled ( x ) ) by the birkhoff - smale theorem . from this we obtain ( 7 ) cl ( psaddled ( x ) ) = cl UNK [ { h ( p ) : p ∈ psaddled ( x ) } UNK . we claim that the family { h ( p ) : p ∈ psaddled ( x ) } is finite . otherwise , there is an_infinite sequence pk ∈ psaddled ( x ) yielding infinitely_many_distinct homoclinic_classes h ( pk ) . consider the closure cl ( sk h ( pk ) ) , which is a compact invariant set contained in cl ( psaddled ( x ) ) . if this closure does_not_contain_any singularity , then it would_be a hyperbolic set ( this follows because r15 ⊂ q1
