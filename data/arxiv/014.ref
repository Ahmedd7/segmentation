pipelining approach under worst - case process conditions ( slow - slow ) has_been followed for clk1 and clk2 signals in fig . 4 to integrate the cnn and the cam module . other methods such as registered pipelining are also possible . the number of transistors in the proposed design is 3 . 4 % higher_than that of the conventional design . in the simulations for measuring the energy_consumption_per search half of the data bits were assumed to mismatch in case of a word mismatch . the delay is measured by the maximum reliable frequency of operation in the worst - case delay scenario . table_ii shows the comparison of the proposed_architecture with some other works including our_own simulations for conventional nand and nor cams . the energy_consumption and the delay of the proposed design can_be converted to 90 nm cmos_technology as in [ 3 ] ( vdd = 1 . 0 v ) for_comparison_purposes using the method in [ 6 ] . the projected values are equal to 0 . 060 fj / bit / search and 0 . 582 ns respectively . v . conclusion in this_paper , a low - power content_addressable memory ( cam ) is introduced . the proposed_architecture employs a novel associativity mechanism based_on a recently_developed family of neural - network - based associative_memories . this architecture is suitable for lowBR2 ] h p t n a u q [ 1 v 5 8 8 6 . 4 0 4 1 : v i x r a abstract algorithmic_cooling ( ac ) is a method to purify quantum_systems , such as ensembles of nuclear_spins , or cold_atoms in an_optical_lattice . when applied to spins , ac produces ensembles of highly_polarized spins , which enhance the signal_strength in nuclear_magnetic_resonance ( nmr ) . according_to this cooling approach , spin - half nuclei in a constant magnetic_field are considered as bits , or more_precisely , quantum bits , in a known probability_distribution . algorithmic steps on these bits are then translated_into specially_designed nmr pulse_sequences using common nmr quantum_computation tools . the algorithmic_cooling of spins is achieved by alternately combining reversible , entropypreserving manipulations ( borrowed_from data compression algorithms ) with selective reset , the transfer of entropy from selected spins to the environment . in theory , applying algorithmic_cooling to sufficiently_large spin systems may produce polarizations far_beyond the limits due_to conservation of shannon_entropy . here , only selective reset steps are performed , hence we prefer to call this process “ heat - bath ” cooling , rather_than algorithmic_cooling . we experimentally implement here two_consecutive_steps of selective reset that transfer_entropy from two selected spins to the environment . we performed such cooling experiments with commercially - available labeled molecules , on standard liquid - state nmr spectrometers . our experiments yielded polarizations that bypass shannon_’ s entropy - conservation bound , so that the entire spin - system was cooled . this_paper was initially submitted in 2005 , first to science and then to pnas , and includes additional results from subsequent years ( e . g . for resubmission inBRthe simulation procedure introduced in section 5 . 1 . we then randomly_choose 20 index pairs ( k , j ) such that there_exists a directed_path_from xk to xj and estimate the causal_effect e0 [ xjdo ( xk ) ] for all k , j on the nine deciles of xk . this is repeated n = 100 times and the squared_error ( 12 ) and the cpu_time consumption - both averaged_over the 20 index pairs - are recorded for each repetition . the experiment is done for two different settings , a sparse graph with an expected number of 50 edges and a non - sparse graph with an expected number of 200 edges . the results are displayed in figure 2 . fig 2 . comparison of the performance of the three presented methods in terms of squared_error ( left ) and cpu_time consumption ( right ) in the case where the true dag d0BR) and by the european_research_council_under the european_union_’_s seventh_framework_program ( fp7_/ 2007 -
