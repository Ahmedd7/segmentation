terms can_be neglected in the long wave - length limit . the full hamiltonian that we consider in this_paper is as follows : h = h0 + u = − i 2 { ∆ ( r ) , ∂ x σ x + ∂ y σ y } . ( 17 ) the hamiltonian ( 17 ) means that the pair potential is spatially deformed by random disorders , which will be 4 explained in the following . a deformation of the pair potential represented_by a small conformal_factor λ ( r ) ( ≪ 1 ) as ∆ ( r ) = ∆ 0e λ ( r ) can_be undertaken by the pauli i e λ ( r ) as σ a ( r ) = matrix with the vierbein field ea ea i ( r ) σ i . thus the hamiltonian ( 17 ) describes the surface majorana_fermions on the curved_space with the metric i ( r ) = δ a gab ( r ) = { σ a ( r ) , σ b ( r ) } = e2 λ ( rBRwith products of variables from short_intervals and applications ’ , proc . steklov_math . inst . , 280 ( 2013 ) , 67 – 96 .

[ 10 ] . in summary , we see that the larger share of interactions in bibsonomy happens with the personal collection . however , the interest in other users ’ content accounts_for a significant part – almost one third of all retrieval requests – of the interaction with the system . copying resources . when users added new posts to their collections , in 11 % of all cases a bookmark or a publication was copied from another user . 6 users copied publications ( 18 % ) more often than bookmarks ( 3 % ) .BRep0 / κ papa , ep0 / κ papa , ( 22 ) it is easily_checked that − k2 0 + ~ k2 + k2 4 = κ 2 ( 23 ) with k0 + k4 > 0 . thus the an ( 3 ) momentum_space manifold is half of four dimensional de_sitter_space . the constant κ determines its curvature and it is usually viewed_as a planckian energy scale , in analogy with the three 4 dimensional example discussed before . translation generators associated_with the group parametrization in terms of k µ exhibit non - trivial coproducts and antipodes reflecting non trivial composition of momenta and their inversion . their expression for time translation generators , at leading_order in the ( inverse ) planckian parameter κ is given by [ 35 ] ∆ ( p0 ) = p0 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ p0 + s ( p0 ) = − p0 + ~ p 2 . 1 κ 1 κ pm ⊗ pm , ( 24 ) ( 25 ) the fact that we have a non - trivial antipode for p0 indicates that the notion of dual representation will be deformed and thus that of the conjugate action on operators as we will see in the following . another key difference with the 2 + 1 - dimensional case is the non - trivial role_played_by lorentz_boosts . it_turns_out_that when the lorentz sector is included in the picture consistency_relations between the action of soBR2 - 1 ) map by girart_et_al .
