τ and rewrite ( 2 . 1 ) , using the second equation ( 2 . 2 ) , in the form : u ν = v sin σ ; bu ν = bv sin ( σ − β ) ; u τ = v cos σ = bv cos ( σ − β ) = bu τ . a shock_wave can_be specified by four parameters of the upstream_flow , the shock intensity j , and the shock direction index χ relative to the upstream_flow . the gas_pressure p , temperature t , velocity polar_angle_θ , and mach_number m are chosen as ( 2 . 3 ) on the sides of the shock . the zero – order problem is confined to determination of the β . since the shock intensity j and its inclination_angle σ for the given incoming flow parameters are interdependent ( for instance , mostovykh & uskov 2011 ) , the shock can_be specified by any of these values ; this fact is used later on . note_that in the zero – order parameters . the shock intensityBRcoherent mini frequency_comb ( mfc ) constituted_by four optical radiations in the visible ( 515 nm & 772 nm ) and in the ir ( 1029 nm & 1544 nm ) . it is worth_noting_that the power of each tooth of this mfc is at_least 3 orders of magnitude_higher_than the available power from each mode of a frequency_comb . the green radiation obtained by frequency_doubling of the 1029 nm laser will be used to detect narrow and intense hyperfine iodine lines at 515 nm , utilizing the well_known saturated_absorption technique . in this way , this signal will permit to frequency stabilize the whole optical_setup . this part of work devoted_to spectroscopy and frequency stabilisation using iodine lines will be subject of another paper . the two 515 nm harmonic beams issued from the two ir sources are combined by an_appropriate beam_splitter and superimposed_on a fast silicon_photodiode ( fig . 5 ) . the incident powers are 0 . 25 mw from master_laser shg and 0 . 5 mw from slave_laser thg . a half wavelength plate is used to optimize the detected optical beatnote in the si photodiode . a first part of this beatnote is monitored by a spectrum_analyzer , while the second one is frequency divided_by a factor 8 before being mixed with the rf reference . the dc signal from the rf mixer is low pass_filtered , and applied to a proportional - integrator ( pi ) device used to drive the ecdl current . this leads to realize a servo loop which compensates the fast frequency fluctuations ( fig . 6 ) . in a free running operation , the width of the optical beatnote ( in the green range ) between the two ir lasers was estimated at aBRtowards lower_frequencies we observe two_types of behavior depending_on_whether the parameter b is greater or smaller_than the critical_value b ∗ = 6 / π ( the actual numerical value may well be slightly_altered by going to higher_orders in the perturbative_expansion , but the important point to note_that it is nonzero and thus gives_rise_to distinct dynamical phases ) . for b > b ∗ the barrier_height grows without bounds and thus effectively traps α ( t ) in one of the two minima , representing a localized phase . this localization can_be brought_about_by increasing the magnitude of η , the numerical_prefactor of our dissipative nonlocal priors , and / or increasing α 1 the distance_between the two possible_interpretations of the data . on the other_hand , for b < b ∗ the potential becomes_ineffective in localizing α , and thus α freely tunnels between the two wells , representing indeterminancy of the correct true model parameter . it is interesting to note_that a flow equation , similar to eq . ( 31 ) , has_been_reported for the opposite_limit ( strong - coupling ) using the instanton method [ 5 , 6 ] . arguably what we have really shown is that even if one starts with weak_coupling , so that it should_be ” easy ” to jump from one interpretation to another , for b > b ∗ we will flow to strong - coupling , at which point known results about localization take over . local 8 c 0 nonlocal b * b figure 2 : schematic rg_flow of the potential energy coupling parameter for m ≥ 2 . note_that the flowBRif we considered r2 of g µ ν ; ρ σ suppressed in ( 4 ) should not contribute to the r2 order in ( the inverse of ) g µ ν ; ρ σ , we could encounter the additional r2 µ ν ρ σ term , which is not originated_from λ [ g µ ν ] . however , it should necessarily accompany higher_derivative curvature terms from the kinetic_term ∂ zg µ ν g µ ν ; ρ σ ∂ zg ρ σ of o ( r3 ) that cannot_be cancelled from the other terms , and it would_be beyond our scope of o ( r2 ) test of the holographic_weyl_anomaly . we therefore conclude_that the truncation ( 4 ) is necessary and sufficient for the o ( r2 ) check of holography . 1 it is also important to realize that the field_redefinition of the type g µ ν → gBRalso % achieves % high % correlahon % r = 0 . 90 . % !_  up % to % t = 0 . 4 , % simulate % our % model % as % usual . % !_  at % t = 0 . 4 , % let % the % system % reach % a % fixed % point % by % dropping % the % temperature % to % zero % and % simulahng % many % steps % with % non ; evolving % hamiltonian . % !_  resume % the % simulahon % from % t = 0 . 4 , % but % with % the % transverse % field % a ( t ) % completely % turned % off . % the % rest % of % the % evoluhon % is % equivalent % to % simulated % annealing % that % starts % at % an % already % low % temperature . % !_  the % model % indicates % that % 8 ; spin % supernodes % with % highly % stable % local % configurahons % get % fixed % early . % the % main % challenge % is % breaking % their % two ; fold % symmetry % based % on % interachon % with % other % supernodes . % in % this % sense , % the % effechve % problem % size % may % be % thought % of % as % closer % to % # % of % supernodes % (BRfinancial_assistance . all the algebraic computations of section 5 are performed by a program in wolfram_mathematica , as_well as sympy and maxima packages for symbolic calculation . references [ 1 ] adam ´_ow , a . and deszcz , r . , on totally_umbilical_submanifolds of some class of riemannian_manifolds , demonstratio_math . , 16 ( 1983 ) , 39 – 59 .
