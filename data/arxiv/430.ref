being responsible_for maintaining it globally coherent . another special_feature of xeon_phi is the fast bidirectional ring interconnect . all connected entities use the ring for communication purposes , using special controllers called ring stops to insert requests and receive responses on the ring . fig . 1 . the intel_xeon_phi architecture . the novelties of the xeon_phi architecture relate to five components : ( 1 ) the vector processing_cores , ( 2 ) the on - chip_memory , ( 3 ) the off - chip_memory , ( 4 ) the ring interconnect , and ( 5 ) the pcie connection . as these are the features that differ , in one way or another , from a typical cpu - vectors are wider , there are many more cores , cache coherency and shared_memory are provided with low penalty for 60 or more cores , and a ring interconnect holds tens of agents that can interchange messages / packets concurrently - , we focus our benchmarking efforts on these features . we also note_that the similarities_between phi and a regular multi - core_cpu allow_us_to adapt existing cpu benchmarks to the requirements of xeon_phi . in most_cases , we use such ” refurbished ” solutions , that prove to serve our_purposes well . b . programming in terms of usability , there are two_ways an application can use intel_xeon_phi : ( 1 ) in offload mode - the main application is running on the host , and it only offloads selected ( highly parallel , computationally_intensive ) work to the coprocessorBR) = [ 0 , ∞ ) . then adding a small rank - 2 perturbation gives the hamiltonian ( ϕ ∈ d θ 0 ∪ tk0 for some k0 , θ 0 > 0 ) , ( 2 . 3 ) UNK p2 h ϕ : = ( ϕ , · ) l2 UNK ϕ 1 UNK p2 + f x ϕ UNK ( ϕ , · ) l2 1 h ϕ ( f ) : = where θ 0 and k0 depend ( in a certain sense specified below ) on the size of ϕ , and ϕ inBR2 . 2 . c4 . 5 ( decision_tree ) this is an algorithm that constructs a simple depth - first decision_tree . it uses information gain with feature_selection and it is easy to implement . classification of unknown records is considerably fast , but it is not suitable for large_datasets because it needs to fit the entire data into memory . 2 . 2 . 3 . k - nearest_neighbor this method is based_on the principle of the nearest k - neighbor of the new data . different computations can_be used as a distance metric and the advantage of this classifier is that it doesn_'_t require any training time . but testing time can_be considerable and classifying unknown records is relatively_expensive . it is also easily fooled in high dimensional spaces . 2 . 2 . 4 . naive_bayes this is a statistical classifier which applies bayes theorem . it assumes that attributes are independent from each_other and is robust to isolated noise points and irrelevant attributes . however independence_assumption may not hold for some attributes and it can cause a loss of accuracy . 2 . 2 . 5 . adaboost it is a combination of classifiers that is constructed from the training_data . it adaptively changes the distribution of training_data with each_iteration by focusing more on previously misclassified records . it can also be used to increase the classification_accuracyBRsimple null ( signal is absent everywhere ) and a composite alternative ( signal is present somewhere ) . we introduce a novel class of scalable sequential_tests which , for any subset of affected sensors , minimize the expected sample_size for a decision asymptotically , that is as the error_probabilities go to 0 . moreover , we_propose sequential_tests that require minimal transmission activity from the sensors to the fusion_center , while_preserving this asymptotic_optimality property . i . introduction a . problem_formulation consider k sources of observations ( sensors ) which transmit their data to a global decision_maker ( fusion_center ) . we assume_that observations from different sensors are independent and that , for each 1 ≤ k ≤ k , sensor k observes a sequence ( x k t ) t ∈ n of independent and identically_distributed ( i . i . d . ) random_variables with common density f k with_respect_to a dominating , σ - finite measure ν k . we denote t , t ∈ n } the filtration_generated_by the observations by { f k s ;
