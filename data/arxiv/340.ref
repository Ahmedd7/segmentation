[ dg02 ] , [ dp06 ] , [ gm ] , [ gm14 ] ) , but the actual proof in general seems to be still far out of reach . in spite of this , in some very special_cases stark – heegner_points are known to be global . in these particular settings they coexist with heegner_points , and they can actually be_seen to be related to them ( cf . [ bd09 ] , [ lv14 ] , [ gss ] ) . the p - adic nature of the points seems to play a key_role in these arguments , by means of the connection_between the formal logarithm of the stark – heegner_points and the special values of suitable p - adic l - functions ( see also [ bdp13 ] , [ dra ] , [ drb ] , and [ bdr ] ) . date : september 18 , 2014 . 2010_mathematics_subject_classification . 11g05 ( 11g18 , 11y50 ) . key_words and phrases . algebraic points on elliptic_curves ,BR. methodology and results of investigations the satellite_images of study area have_been selected in such a way that they cover some known different land_use ground features with well defined and arbitrary geometry as mentioned in the investigation result tables . the important component of any edge detection method is the selection of parameters like threshold value , kernel , intensity interpolation method etc . different edge detection techniques were_analyzed using different sample images with regard to the context of object extraction . it was_found that certain features can_be better extracted using specific algorithms . the complexity analyses of the various edge detection methods were done using standard analysis techniques . the parameters that we used for analysis are the ideal threshold value for the detection of the various images , the noticeable features in the edge image etc . theBR. nanopoulos , and k . a . olive , “ flipped heavy_neutrinos : from the solar_neutrino_problem to baryogenesis , ” phys . lett . b300 , 121 ( 1993 ) , hep - ph / 9211325 .
