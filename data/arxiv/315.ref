[ 10 ] . the major systematic_uncertainties on the results reported_here come_from uncertainties in the determination of the anisotropic flows . two v2 measurements are used [ 7 ] . one is the two - particle_cumulant v2 { 2 } which overestimates elliptic_flow due_to nonflow contaminations . a major component of nonflow comes_from correlated pairs at small opening_angle [ 29 ] . to suppress nonflow , a pseudo - rapidity η - gap ( η gap ) of 0 . 7 is applied between the particle of interest and the reference particle used in the v2 { 2 } measurement . however , away - side two - particle correlations , such as those due_to di - jets , cannot_be eliminated . the other measurement is the four - particle_cumulant v2 { 4 } which underestimates elliptic_flow because the flow fluctuation effect inBRalgorithm declares that is not able_to find a feasible point . this corresponds_to the loop in the lower part of the block_diagram in figure 1 . the pseudo - code of the subchannel reassignment heuristic is listed in algorithm 1 , which corresponds_to the sequence of blocks 4 , 2 , 3 in figure 1 . the power_allocation algorithms have computational_complexity o ( kn ) [ 15 ] and the sus search algorithm has complexity o ( km 3 ) . assuming the worst_case where all subchannels are examined for reassignment , the proposed_algorithm ’_s overall computational_complexity is o ( kn 2 ) , if n > m 3 o ( knm 3 ) , otherwise .
