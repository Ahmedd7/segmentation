angle dependence of the resonances , detected by a rectification_effect as a voltage , were_analysed to determine the symmetries and relative_magnitudes of the spin - orbit_torques . both anti - damping ( slonczewski ) and field - like torques were observed . as the ferromagnet thickness was reduced from 3 to 1 nm , the sign of the field - like torque reversed . this observation is consistent_with the emergence of a rashba_spin orbit_torque in ultra - thin bilayers . current - induced spin - orbit_torques in ultrathin ferromagnetic / heavy_metal bilayers provide ways to electrically control magnetisation . two mechanisms for observed torques have_been_proposed , both of which could_contribute to the total torques and both of which originate in the spin - orbit_interaction . a schematic of both mechanisms is shown in figure 1a . the first mechanism is due_to the spin - hall_effect , 1 – 4 where a charge - current in the heavy_metal layer generates spin_currents perpendicular to the charge - current . when a spin -BRcorresponding estimate from the monte - carlo_simulation for xe doping is indicated in fig . 2 as dashed_lines . clearly , the onset of significant nanodroplet destruction in this case of xe doping occurs well beyond the kcr ( ∼ 10 ) observed in the experiment . thus , the process of dopantinduced ignition is not influenced_by evaporation effects . the insensitivity of dii with_respect_to the droplet_sizes results simply from the fact that dii sets in with the formation of a cigar shaped plasma which is much_smaller_than the droplet itself [ 9 ] . in contrast , dii should depend_on the laser_intensity and similarly on the ionization_potential of the seed atoms , as_well as on the pulse length . the former dependences are illustrated with experimental_results in fig . 3 . as expected , kcr is smaller for higher intensities and / or lower ionization_potentials . we determined numerically the average he charge in a droplet y ( k ) as a function of the number of xe dopants k . one can see in fig . 4 that at the intensity of 7 ×_1014 w /_cm2 a qualitative_change of the average charge per he atomBR, σ cm , 2 , σ UNK m + 1 , 2 , σ cm , 3 , σ UNK i . m , σ 0i , d † m , 3 , σ 0i , d † m , σ = ( c † m , σ = ( c † using as a complete set of the one - electron states the states l † m + 1 , σ 0i ( σ = ↑ , ↓ ) m , 2 , σ ) / √ 2 , we find all 45 eigenstates α i and their energies e α of with l † the unperturbed_hamiltonian_h0 ( a1 ) in the two - electron subspace . the ground_state of the unperturbed_hamiltonian_h0 in the two - electron subspace gsi is four - fold_degenerate , i . e . , consists of the 3 triplet_states , t , 1i = l † m + 1 , ↑ 0i , m + 1 , ↓ 0i , and the singlet_state , si = ( 1 / √ 2 ) ( l † t , 0i = ( 1 / √ 2 ) ( l † m + 1 , ↓ − l † m , ↓ l † sBR( 4 . 28 ) and the sharp differential estimate ( 4 . 27 ) . by the inequalities w ∗ 2 ( f , χ h ) ≤ and ( 4 . 25 ) , ( 4 . 26 ) we have h2 24kd2fk , w ∗ 2 ( f , χ 2 h ) ≤ h2 12kd2fk , en − 1 ( f ) ≤ 1 32n2 UNK 1 + 2 α 2 3 UNK kd2fk . probably , by using sharp_estimates in theorem 3 , for small α , one can reduce the α 2 - coefficient 2 / 3 and obtain the better correspondence_between differential and difference estimates in the direct theorems of approximation theory . acknowledgment the author is greatly_indebted to y . kryakin for suggesting the problem and for many stimulating_conversations and valuable_comments . references 11 [ 1 ] a . g . babenko , n . v . dolmatova , y . v . kryakin , jackson ’_s exact inequality with a special modulus of continuity . trudy inst . mat . i mekh . uro ran 18 ( 4 ) ( 2012 ) 51 – 67 ( in russian ) .
