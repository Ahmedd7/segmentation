[ 49 ] and express the transition amplitude in a vinicity of the complex pole energy zr = er − i γ r / 2 as fij ( z ) = f bg ij ( z ) − 1 2 ( kikj ) 1 / 2 bibj z − zr , ( 14 ) where the non - resonant background contribution f bg and the dependence of the resonant part on the on - shell momenta kj are shown explicitly . the symmetric matrix bibj has rank 1 and the complex couplings bj can_be determined from the residui of elastic_scattering amplitudes calculated at the pole energy . they are related to the partial_widths γ j = bj 2 = lim z → zr 2kj ( z − zr ) fjj ( z ) ( 15 ) that refer to the probability of the resonant state decaying_into the j - th channel . in reality , a resonant state can decay only into channels that are open at a given energy , so our eq . ( 15 ) does_not make a good sense for channels with thresholds much_higher_than the pole energy er . however , in a case of a broad_resonance ( when the pole is not close to the real_axis ) the branching_ratios calculated at the complex pole energy zr may differ_significantly_from the branching_ratios established in experiment and assigned to the resonance_peak energy . in addition , a tail of a resonance can also contribute to experimentaly measuredBRintel_xeon phis , high - end multi - core_cpus are consistently outperformed by these novel , more integrated , architectures both in terms of data_processing rate and memory_bandwidth . as a consequence , the working environment of today_’ s application_developers evolved toward a multi - level massively_parallel environment , where computation becomes cheap but data movements expensive , driving sup the energetic_cost and algorithmic overheads and complexities . with the advent of apis for gpu_programming , such as cuda or opencl , programming accelerators has_been rapidly_evolving in the past_years , permanently bringing accelerators into the mainstream . hence , gpus are becoming a more and more attractive_alternative to traditional cpus , particularly for their more_interesting cost - per - flop and watts - per - flop ratios . however , the availability of a particular programming api only partially addresses the development of hybrid algorithms capable of taking_advantage of all computational_resources available , including accelerators and cpus . extracting a satisfactory level
