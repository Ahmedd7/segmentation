[ 29 , 30 ] ) . and finally , there has_recently_been considerable focus_on random matrix universality ( see , e . g . , [ 8 ] ) , and our_approach is likely to be of interest in that context too . the plan of the paper is the following . section ii is devoted_to a short discussion of random matrix universality . it is well_known that standard random matrix_ensembles with different one - body potentials lead to different ( non - universal ) densities of eigenvalues . nevertheless , it is widely_accepted that afterBR, p . jarilloherrero , and b . j . leroy , nature_mater . 10 , 282 ( 2011 ) . 15 s . engels , a . epping , c . volk , s . korte , b . voigtlander , and k . watanabe , t . taniguchi , s . trellenkamp , c . stampfer , appl . phys . lett . 103 , 073113 ( 2013 ) . 16 l . britnell , r . v . gorbachev , a . k . geim , l . a . ponomarenko , a . mischenko , m . t . greenaway , t . m . fromhold , k . s . novoselov , and l . eaves , nature_comm . 4 , 1794 ( 2012 ) . 17 l . wang , i . meric , p . y . huang , q . gao , y . gao , h . tran , t . taniguchi , k . watanabe , l . m . campos , d . a . muller , j . guo , p . kim , j . hone , k . l . shepard , and c . r . dean , nature_nanotech . 5 , 722 ( 2010 ) . 18 d . golla
