these experiments have large_numbers of data points , and rather_small quoted normalization uncertainties ( 3 % , 1 % , and 2 . 6 % respectively ) . we found in previous cteq_global analyses , e . g . , in calculating the uncertainty of w ± or z 0 production_cross_sections at the tevatron , that allowing these normalizations to vary beyond their published standard_deviations could produce fits with fairly_small χ 2 , for quite large_deviations of σ w or σ z . but these fits were not acceptable because_they required large shifts in the normalizations of the dis data [ 28 ] . for this reason we have chosen both in the past and in the current higgs study ( including the published ct10 hessian set ) to fix the normalizations of these three experiments at their best_fit_values . 13 c . the lm calculation of the combined pdf + α s uncertainty of σ h in the previous_subsection , we presented results using the lm method , while treating α s ( mz ) as a fixed parameter , equal to the current world - average value . we now consider the combined pdf and α s ( mz ) effects in the lm method , by including the world - average constraints on α s ( mz ) directly in the χBRi β b λ r γ ) ( i α b µ r ) ( i γ δ λ u β ) δ µ u α , b2 UNK 2x γ where p γ in b2 denotes summation_over_all sub - sequences γ of α which have length 1 , and β denotes α \ γ . here , and later on in the proof , λ and µ are from λ 0 . by ( 3 . 5 ) we have ( i α b λ r ) ( i α b µ r ) u α λ u α µ = ( b λ r + h2o α b λ r ) ( b µ r + h2o α b µ r ) u α λ u α µ = b λ rb µ ru α λ u α µ + ( b λ ro α b µ r + b µ ro α b λ r ) ( r λ u α ) ( r µ u α ) + ( p αBRit is now possible to emulate these hierarchical_structures , for example using ultra - high strength nanoscale building_blocks made of carbon and inorganic nanotubes ( 1d ) and platelets ( 2d ) , and metals with nanoscale interfaces ( 3d ) as the load - bearing components3 - 8 . the high intrinsic strength of these nanomaterials is often_difficult to maintain in large - scale composites because a macroscopic ensemble of these structures routinely contain structural and / or chemical flaws within individual constituents or at the interfaces , which are sources of failure - initiation9 , 10 . classical fracture_mechanics dictates that susceptibility to fracture depends_on sample and / or external flaw length_scales . this implies that different behavior may_occur atBRof the sea - quark asymmetry is needed to reduce its uncertainty and eventually discriminate_between these models . • the polarized sea - quark asymmetry has approximately the same absolute size as its unpolarized counterpart , but it is affected_by a larger uncertainty ( see right_plot in fig . 2 ) . even within this uncertainty , it is clear that polarized and unpolarized asymmetries have opposite_sign . however , it is difficult to decide_whether the expectation ∆ ¯ u − ∆ ¯ d > ¯ u − ¯ d , predicted for instance by the cqs model , is actually fulfilled . note_that this implies that the bjorken_sum_rule ( which is proportional to the first moment of the triplet pdf combination ∆ t3 = ∆ u + ∆ ¯ u − ∆ d − ∆ ¯ d ) is not_entirely given by valence_quarks : also sea quaks can contribute to it , through their flavor_asymmetry . in conclusion we have shown , for the first time , that w - boson_production data favor ∆ ¯ u > 0 > ∆ ¯ d and a positive flavor_asymmetry of polarized_light antiquarksBR( µ ) } any sequence of real_numbers_satisfying q ( µ ) →_∞ as µ → 0 . assume { x ( n ) : µ > 0 , n < ∞ } is tight or bounded in probability . then , for each η ≥ 0 , there_exists γ ( η ) ≥ 0 such that if γ ≤ γ ( η ) in ( 8 ) , x µ ( · + q ( µ ) ) ⇒ x η , as µ → 0 .
