and maintain data in a local system . in modern molecular_biology , the genome is the entirety of an organism ' s hereditary information . it is encoded either in dna or , for many types of virus , in rna . the genome includes both the genes and the noncoding sequences of the dna . ( ridley , m . ( 2006 ) genome ) . algorithms for compressing dna_sequences , such as gencompress [ 1 ] , biocompress [ 2 ] and cfact [ 3 ] are available to compress dna_sequences . their compression_rate is about 1 . 74 bits_per base i . e . , 78 % in compression_rate . hence we present a new compression algorithm named ” genbit compress tool ” whose compression_rate is below 1 . 2 bits_per byte ( for best case ) , 1 . 727 bits / bytes ( for average case ) , 2 . 238 bits / bytes ( worst_case ) even for larger genome ( nearly 2 , 00 , 000 characters ) . 1 . 1 . existing compression algorithms most of the compression methods used today including dna compression fall_into_two categories . UNK first is statistical method , which compresses data by replacing a more_popular symbol to a shorter code . UNK second is dictionary - based scheme , which compresses data by replacing long sequences by short pointer information to the same sequences in a dictionary . in statistical_methods , arithmetic_coding and ctw are known to compress the dna data well [ 4 ] and huffman_coding is known to compress not very_efficiently . the burrows - wheeler_transform ( bwt , also called block - sorting compression ) , ( michael burrows and david wheeler . )BRh p + 2 n 0n , n h p n ( jh p _ = UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK = UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK = UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK 0n , n h p n ( jh p h p n jh p n n ) ( n ) 0n , n h p 0n , n n h p 0n , n n ( jh p n ) ( n ) − j 2 ( h p n + 12 · σ p + 1 n = ( − 1 ) n + 1h p + 1 .

binding system of side_length l . diamonds : kwant with the mumps - based solver . dots : an efficient c implementation of the rgf algorithm . the continuous curves show the theoretically_expected scaling for large l : o ( l2 logl ) for mumps - based kwant solver , and o ( l2 ) for rgf . small by today_’ s standards but whose inclusion would have obstructed the power - law character of the curves . it was measured as the increase of the maximum “ resident set size ” taken up by a given computation over that reported for an empty run of the respective software . 8 . conclusion the kwant project has a double objective . first , to gather high - performance algorithms that are useful in the field of quantum transport . second , to provide a simple and clear but powerful user_interface for defining and working with tight - binding models . we refrained_from designing such an interface from_scratch ( an approach that usually does_not age well ) but_rather chose to extend an existing language ( python ) with new capabilities . in this approach , the usual input_files present in most scientific_software disappearBRrespectively for elliptic_curves and abelian_varieties fully of type gsp respectively : note , under the asymmetric assumptions of theorem 1 we do_not get k ′ ℓ = k ℓ but only k ′ ℓ ⊆ k ℓ . proof of theorem 3 . both conditions also hold over a finite extension of k because every number field has a density - one of primes of degree one . since we are only interested in a ¯ k - isogeny we may then replace k by a finite_galois_extension and assume_that all homomorphisms between the considered abelian_varieties are defined over k . the assumptions are also invariant_under a k - isogeny so weBRhowever , the differential_equation_satisfied by t ( τ , s ) cannot_be constrained to be first order in space and time as in eq . 8 . nevertheless the mechanism for constructing t ( τ , s ) is equivalent to taking_linear_combinations of the two step process given by equations 9 and 10 for different values of k and b . at any given s , w { k , b } is a unimodal function with a peak at τ − τ UNK = k / bs . arbitrary combinations of w { k , b } will result in undesirable shapes of the window function , hence the values of k and b should_be appropriately_tuned . figure 2 shows the window functions constructed from four combinations of b and k given in combinations of w { k , bBRlines . the cowl shock interacts_with the expansion fan and ramp boundary_layer . large adverse pressure_gradients are produced by this interaction and cause a second separation bubble on the intake wall . in the interior region , the flow is going_through several reflected shock_waves . the grid has 44 cells in the flow direction and 6 cells in the cross - flow direction on refinement level l = 0 . to ensure a minimum wall distance of 10 − 6 m on the the final level l = 4 grid , the grid_points in wall - normal direction are stretched towards the walls using a poisson_distribution . transverse to the wall the grid lines are almost_always orthogonal to the walls to resolve the strong wall gradients accurately . the uniform_grid on refinement level l = 4 has 67 , 584 cells . table 6 shows the evolution of the grid size during the adaptive computation . in comparison to the uniformly refined grid , the adaptive grid is composed of only 60 % of the grid_cells . figure 14 presents the grid at the different refinement_levels and figure 15 the mach_number contours corresponding to the different grid levels . during the first and the second adaptation , most cells are refined . the third adaptation only refines the cells near the shock_waves and in the boundary_layers as_well as the separation areas . after the third adaptation , the grid is on the highest refinement level . during the fourth adaptation , only a reordering of the cells is performed . henceBR32 ] and the contrast -

[ 1 ] states that discrete rossby / drift wave resonant_triads counted by [ 2 ] must have complex amplitudes . we agree : indeed , the dynamical_system ( 4 ) for a resonant triad in [ 2 ] is written out for complex amplitudes . [ 1 ] states also that in [ 3 ] the authors counted triads with real amplitudes and that this is the source of discrepancy_between the number of triads found by [ 2 ] and by [ 3 ] . however , [ 3 ] regard stream function ψ = exp { i [ kx + ky − ω ( k , l ) t ] } of complex variable ( see expression ( 2 ) in [ 3 ] ) . that only triads with real amplitudes are regarded is not mentioned in [ 3 ] . as in the previous_papers of the first_author of [ 3 ] ( e . g .
