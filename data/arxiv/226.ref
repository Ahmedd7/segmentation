[ 32 , 33 ] where a value α = 1 / 6 is obtained in 2d for bv functions , while the simple analysis above leads to α = 1 / 2 ) . 6 . 2 . discretization by projection on a wavelet_basis in this section , we set l0 = 0 and thus assume_that every u ∈ l2 ( [ 0 , 1 ] ) can_be decomposed_as u = hu , φ 0i φ 0 + hu , ψ j , mi ψ j , m . + ∞ x 2j − 1x j = 0 m = 0 in order to get a representation of the operator in a finite_dimensional setting , we truncate the wavelet representation at scale j . this way , we obtain an operator 19 h acting_on a space of dimension n , where n = 1 + pj j = 0 2j denotes the numbers of wavelets kept to represent images . it can_be written in the following convenient form : ( 21 ) h = ψ θ ψ ∗ . in this equation , ψ : rn → rn isBR= ha δ : δ < λ i is a filtration of a , while δ ∈ s is such that a δ is generated_by { a α : α < δ } . we define inv ¯ a , δ ( a δ ) def = { i < θ : ( ∃ δ ′ ∈ ( α δ i , α δ i + 1 ] ) ( ∀ α < α δ i ) a α ∩ a δ = a α ∩ a ′ δ mod a α ∩ a δ = ac means that for any element w of a and ac α δ i α ∩ a ′ δ mod a } , α δ i we have w ≤ a iff w ≤ b . α δ i where a = b mod a α δ i definition 6 . 3 suppose that l is a linear order with universe λ . we define a boolean_algebra a [ l ] as being generated_by { a α : α < λ } freely except for the equations a δ ≤ a ε ⇐_⇒ δ ≤ l ε . ( 4 ) since the equations in ( 4 ) are finitely consistent_with the axioms of a boolean_algebra it_follows from the compactness theorem that the algebra a [ l ] is well defined . now we_shall see a translation between the calculation of the invariants of the linear orders and the associated boolean_algebras . sublemma 6 . 4 let l be a linear order on λ and a [ l ] the algebra associated to l as per definitionBR= 7 and γ ∈ [ − 4 α π , 4 α π ] . it shows that the states α , ± γ i are also sufficiently distinguishable when γ is around the values of α π ( 2l + 1 ) , l = 0 , ± 1 , ± 2 , . . . .

( 12 ) we notice_that the jaynes - cummings_model has_been_realized in the laboratory in several well - known ways [ 14 – 16 ] . we note_that the excitation number here the projection_operators p ± for atom state are n = 1 2 σ z + a † a + 1 2 , ( 13 ) p ± = is a conservativeBRthe ∆ t making the rbcs contribution larger . however , contrary to what ciovati et_al . state , the step - like increase of rs above t λ does_not automatically_imply that this contribution matters below t λ . the temperature_range , which was used for such deconvolution ( t < 2 . 17 k ) in our original paper , was actually intentionally chosen to avoid any non - negligible thermal_effects . since ciovati et_al . select the temperature_range including temperatures above t λ then thermal modeling and therefore relying_on the values of kapitza resistance and thermal_conductivity taken from sample measurements elsewhere becomes necessary . this additional layer of indeterminacy ( unnecessary below t λ ) provides an_extra source of systematic_error , which negates the advantages of a larger range for pre - factor a and gap u fitting . the second claim by ciovati et_al . made from the beginning and throughout the article is that doping “ significantly amplifies the low - field q increase up to a factor of ∼ 2 and extends it to much_higher fields b = µ_0h ≈ 60 − 90 mt than what had_beenBR- like particle in a classical potential , but sometimes it performs random jumps . semiclassical part . semiclassical_approximation is valid when an atom moves between standing - wave nodes ( kf x UNK = π / 2 + π n , cos [ kf x ] UNK = 0 ) . this motion is regular and may be described by the hamiltonian [ 13 – 16 ] ( ω a − ω f [ t ] ) 2 4 ω 2 h = p 2 2ma +  ω u ∓ , u ∓ = ∓ cos2 [ kf x ] + ( 1 ) here ω is a rabi_frequency ( field intensity ) and kfBRat 5 t , suggesting that the order is suppressed by weak_magnetic_fields . the frustration factor f , which is the ratio of the weiss_temperature to the transition_temperature expressed_as f = θ / tn and is used to measure the strength of magnetic_frustration , is 16 for naba2mn3f11 . it is larger_than_those of kagome antiferromagnets : 10 and 14 for fe - and cr - jarosites , 19 , 20 ) respectively , and 9 for vesignieite . 25 ) this suggests_that the magnetic_frustration is crucial in naba2mn3f11 . the heat_capacity divided_by temperature , c / t , of naba2mn3f11 increases with decreasing_temperature below ~ 20 k and shows a jump at 2 . 0 k indicating aBRand to john_tate , for getting one of us interested in the conjectural mordellic property of hyperbolic varieties . finally , we are also happy to acknowledge_partial_support the following sources : the agence_nationale_de_la_recherche grants anr -
