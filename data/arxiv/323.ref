the slope crosses the line f = 0 at √ sn n ∼ 20 gev , which is twice larger_than the experimental crossing point , and then stays negative and almost constant with further energy increase . however , the absolute_values of the calculated proton slopes in this high_energy range are on the level of – ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 02 ) , while the measured ones are about – 0 . 005 . the standard urqmd_model results , as cited in the experimental paper [ 39 ] and in the more_recent theoretical work [ 40 ] , are displayed in fig . 3 by the wide and narrow shaded_areas , respectively . these results for protons are close to those from the hsd model and essentially overestimate the slope for energies below ∼ 30 gev but at higher energy become negative and relatively_close to the experiment . the predictions for the pure hadronic version of the transport model hsd [ dotted_lines in fig . 3 ( a ) ] slightly_differ from the phsd results , which overpredict the negative proton slope at higher rhic_energies . 0 pBRgpu and consists of two stages . we try to exchange states between replicas i and i + 1 for which i is even in the first stage , respectively i is odd in the second_stage ( states were indexed from 0 ) . these stages are executed using two_consecutive kernels . random_numbers are generated using the curand library [ 18 ] , which facilitates the simple and efficient generation of high - quality pseudorandom_numbers . the resulting random_numbers are stored in global_memory . the default pseudorandom engine is an implementation of the xorshift rng [ 19 ] and it produces higher quality random_numbers than the linear_congruential generator . the source_code for all the simulations discussed in the present_paper is available_online [ 20 ] . 5 . simulation_results and benchmarks listing 1 : copying spin values from global to shared_memory and store them back to global_memory at the end of the metropolis cycle 5 . 1 . thermodynamic_properties the interaction energy computation is parallelized among the threads inBR1 UNK at 13 UNK u1 b UNK UNK − 1 UNK at 23 UNK c t a . 22 at b 32 33 substituting this into ( 24 ) and using the last equation in ( 18 ) , we obtain the following qsdes of the form ( 7 ) which describe the network : 32 33 22 at 23 at 22 at 23 at 32 33 b b UNK UNK − 1 b UNK UNK − 1 b 1 2 at a = UNK − c c t + ı d UNK a − UNK c 0 UNK UNK i − UNK at − UNK c 0 UNK UNK i − UNK at + UNK at + UNK at 24 at 24 at c t a at 34 34 + at 14 u1 . y4 = at 24 32 33 at b UNK UNK i − UNK at b UNK UNK i − UNK at at 22 at 23 at 22 at 23 at 32 33 12 at 22 at UNK at 23 UNK c t a UNK at 13 UNK u1 ;
