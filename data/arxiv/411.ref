[ 10 , 39 , 40 ] . a common way of deriving solutions to this equation is to use the method of matched_asymptotic_expansions [ 12 , 39 , 41 , 42 ] . we will use a slightly_simpler approach which omits the edl , while still capturing the essential physics of the problem . let_us_consider the magnitude of the terms in eq .

( 8 ) the greater_flexibility of the gaussian_process afforded_by the increased number of basis_functions leads to greater variational freedom , but the regularisation due_to the bayesian prior mitigates the risk of overfitting . while the coefficients in the lsrbf approach are calculated to achieve the best_possible fit of the data and therefore risk overfitting , gpr ( d ) takes_account both of the noise associated_with the input data through σ y UNK and of the expected similarity of different data points through kf UNK , f UNK . a comparison of eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) shows that both approaches have a computational_complexity that scales similarly with the number of data points , requiring the construction ofBRand the microcanonical calculations yield different solutions , in the region where the competition of the waves is relevant at ∆ ≃ 1 / 3 . several interesting observations can_be made to appreciate the physical_consequences of the predicted inequivalence . first , we notice_that three tricritical_point are also found in the microcanonical setting . imagine to assign a value of ∆ which is smaller_than the value for which the leftmost microcanonical tricritical_point is found , but larger_than the value that identifies the location of the intermediate canonical tricritical_point . when starting in the microcanonical region i and moving vertically ( keeping ∆ fixed ) in the microcanonical phase_diagram , from small to large tmc , one induces a smooth transition towards region ii . interestingly , and at odd with what_happens in the canonical setting for an identical choice of ∆ , region iii can also be reached by acting_on the temperature tmc . in other_words , while in the canonical_ensemble , for dedicated choices of ∆ , only two adjacent regions can_be explored when adjusting the temperature , in the microcanonical_ensemble it is in principle possible to go_through all three , macroscopically_distinct , states by continuously_changing the energy , hence the microcanonical temperature , of the system .BR. while tshift for wasp - 52 might_be too_small to detect , a more_precise_determination of its age could_be used to distinguish_between the different migration scenarios . finally , wasp - 4 and wasp - 19 are consistent_with high - eccentricity migration only according_to zahn ’_s ( 1966 ; 1989 ) prescription . for wasp - 19 in particular , the fairly rapid orbital decay could_lead to a significant tshift which , if detected , would provide an important confirmation of these_ideas . the 3 - d numerical_simulations by penev_et_al .
