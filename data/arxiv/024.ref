disks . one of the most recent_advances is the advent of generalpurpose gpus , which allow orders of magnitude better_performance for certain algorithms . one problem that these systems do_not solve , however , is interactive rendering . in fact , even noninteractive rendering is prohibitively_expensive , when a three - minute movie can take over a week to render on a computing cluster . if the data to be rendered is multiple terabytes , there is no way to avoid scanning_through the entire_dataset to produce a perfect rendering . this is acceptable if one_knows exactly_what to look for , but this is hardly_ever the case . to examine the collision of two small galaxies in a simulation containing millions of them , one would have to painstakingly pore over the data looking for such an event before being_able to set up the correct rendering , a tedious process that could take weeks . the data under_consideration comes_from the aquarius gravitational simulations of dark_matter_particles . in the version dealt_with by the program , there are 150 million simulations , n - body particles in each_timestep and 128 timesteps in all , giving over 20 billion total particles . the full size of this simulation takes up 1 . 4 terabytes on diskBRdouble blue_straggler sequences in gcs : the case of ngc_3621 e . dalessandro2 , f . r . ferraro2 , d . massari2 , b . lanzoni2 , p . miocchi2 , g . beccari3 , a . bellini4 , a . sills5 , s . sigurdsson6 , a . mucciarelli2 , l . lovisi2 2 dipartimento_di_fisica e_astronomia , universit_` a degli_studi_di_bologna , viale_berti 3 european_southern_observatory , karl_schwarzschild strasse 2 , d -

quality images_acquired with the wfc3 on board the hst to probe the blue_straggler star ( bss ) population of the galactic_globular_cluster ngc_362 . we have found two_distinct sequences of bss : this is the second case , after m 30 , where such a feature has_been_observed . indeed the bss location , their extension in magnitude and color and their radial_distribution within the cluster nicely resemble_those observed in m 30 , thus suggesting that the same interpretative scenario can_be applied : the red bss sub - population is generated_by mass_transfer binaries , the blue one by collisions . the discovery of four new w uma stars , three of which lying along the red - bss sequence , further supports this scenario . we also found that the inner portion of the density_profile deviates_from a king model and is well_reproduced_by either a mild power -

dependence of the activity of a pathway consisting of glucose oxidase ( gox ) and the horseradish peroxidase ( hrp ) was_demonstrated [ 24 ] : when the enzymes are brought_closer together , the efficiency of the two enzyme complex increases . here we study theoretically the impact of enzyme positioning on the flux of pathways . it_has_been_demonstrated previously [ 25 ] that in a simple linear reaction -
