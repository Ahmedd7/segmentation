x , x + ] and [ y , y + ] . since x and y are both in [ u , u + ] , this implies that either x belongs_to [ y , y + ] or y belongs_to [ x , x + ] ( depending_on_whether y ∈ [ u , x ] or x ∈ [ u , y ] ; see fig . 5 ) . hence , x and y are adjacent and d + ( u ) is a clique . the other three_cases are similar . to complete the proof we show that , if g is non - bipartite , then d − [ u ] = d + [ u ] = ∅ . assume to the contrary that d + [ u ]BRis that analytical green_’_s functions can_be replaced_by a steady stokes_solver with a stochastic stress_tensor , as dictated_by fluctuating_hydrodynamics . specifically , the action of the required response functions ( on both deterministic and stochastic terms ) is computed “ on the fly ” rather_than pre - computed_analytically . the fluid solver can_be used to handle nontrivial boundary_conditions , including cases where the concentration of chemical reactants affects the fluid_flow via osmo - phoretic effects [ 47 , 48 ] . the stochastic increments required to simulate the brownian_motion are generated_by the fluctuating stokes_solver with no additional_effort , in arbitrary domains with a combination of standard periodic , no - slip or slip boundaries [ 49 ] . because in confined systems the mobility strongly_depends_on the positions of the particles relative to the boundaries , we pay_special_attention to correctly capturing the well - known stochastic drift_term proportional to the divergence of the configurationdependent mobility matrix . in particular , we develop a random finite_difference approach that is related , but distinct from , the traditional fixman midpoint_method . 2 rather closely_related to our_proposal is the work on the stochastic immersed_boundary_method ( sibm ) and its generalization the stochastic eulerian lagrangian method ( selm ) developed by atzberger and collaborators [ 17 , 50 ] , as_well as the work of maxeyBRplan fluor epi p 100 × , 0 . 9 na ) , were we observed count_rates of 65 kcnts / s and 600 kcnts / s , without and with = 3 . 3 . 11 a ) 5 µ m2 μ mb ) c ) 2 μ m the sil , respectively . based_on the specified numerical apertures , the collection angle of the oil and air objectives should_be the same . this substantial_difference in count_rate cannot_be explained by the increase of the reflection losses at the air -

conservative mass_transfer from the primary to the companion accompanied_by a simultaneous mass_loss via a wind , during at_least several pre - merger years . let_us investigate this in more_detail . the tidal_friction timescale for a star of mass m1 and radius r1 in a binary with a companion of mass m2 at an orbital_separation a can_be estimated as ( eggleton_&_kiseleva -
