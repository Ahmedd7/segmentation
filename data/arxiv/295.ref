the simplest one is a mere markov_approximation . then , we have proposed an erlang phase - type approximation of the state holding time with exponentially_distributed transitions at each erlang sub - states . we have shown analytically the convergence properties of this model the complexity of this model , we have proposed and analyzed also a simplified erlang model . to deterministic state holding time . given the results of our analysis is that for very_short message transfer time , the simple markov_approximation provides good estimates of the probability of consistency . when the message transfer time increases , the markov_approximation tends_to significantly_overestimate of this probability . in this case the erlang - based model is preferable , and the simplified_version is acceptable . when messages are transferred through reliable techniques , the simplified erlang model provides very_good estimates , that make it a suitable approach for supporting future_research_directions , applying them also to environments other_than sdds , such as general signaling frameworks [ 12 ] [ 16 ] . references [ 1 ] p . ji , z . ge , j . kurose , and d . towsley , “ a comparison of hard - state and soft - state signaling protocols , ”_ieee / acm_trans . netw . , vol . 15 , no . 2 , 2007 , pp . 281 - 294 .
