monotonicity occurs in the cms data for the 2s state . figure 6 shows the same plot as fig . 5 for the 2s state but employing temperature modeled by using charged_particle_multiplicity . the marked change in gradient at around 150 ≤ npart ≤ 200 ( as observed in fig . 5 ) is not obtained here . figure 7 shows the suppression of 1s against npart with the color_screening scenario alone , with gluonic_dissociation and collisional_damping alone , and net suppression including all the three effects . here again temperature is determined_by using npart . the gradient of suppression for 1s due_to screening can_be seen to flatten_out at a lower npart as compared to the 2s case . furthermore , the gradients of the ” * ” curve ( color_screening ) and the ” + ” curve ( gluonic_dissociation plus collisional_damping ) cross over at around npart = 250 and they begin to differ_significantly in the region 100 ≤ npart ≤ 150 . in fig . 8 , we finally show the prediction of survival_probability of υ ( 1p ) state with color_screening and gluonic_dissociation along with collisional_dampingBR. the gap becomes deeper and wider in all bands although for the sub - mm_wavelengths this effect is stronger , indicating that indeed , big grains of dust are more subject to the depletion generated_by the planet at these radii . the loss of structure in r and h intensity images due_to the convolution with the instrumental psf is also present in these cases ( blue and yellow solid_lines in middle and lower right_panels of figure 3 ) . again , alma is able_to detect the overall_shape of the corresponding profile in the theoretical images , showing a ring at about r ∼ 50 au where the maximum of the theoretical profiles is placed . the polarimetric images are also able_to show structure in the r < 50 au inner_radii in these two planet mass cases . h -BRon board for processing of images and sent to ground by telemetry for further application to any data on the ground . the flatfield_correction array is applied in a simple multiplicative way . the procedure of flatfield_correction can_be made on ground ( or , reversely , the on -

th gate has_been_applied . then if there is a constant ξ independent of n such that , for all n and t ∈ [ n ] , ψ t UNK has ξ exponential_decay of correlations , one can classically simulate the evolution of the quantum_circuit in poly ( n , k ) time . the corollary says_that one must have at_least algebraically_decaying correlations in a quantum_circuit if it is supposed to solve a classically hard problem more_efficiently . interestingly such kind of long_range correlations are usually associated to critical phases of matter . from a quantum_information perspective , the result gives a limitation to the possibility of hiding information in 1d quantum_circuits : if correlations are hidden in all partitions at_most times , the computation can_be simulated efficiently classically . indeed if that is the case , then the state of the quantum_computation at_most time_steps will have an efficient matrix product representation and we can use the results of [ 34 ] to give an efficient classical simulation for it . techniques : the key_idea of the proof comes_from the analysis of random states given in fig . 2 . there we could find a partition of the system into three regions abc such thatBRgold backing . the γ -
