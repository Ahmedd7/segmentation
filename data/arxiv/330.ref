ray_burst symposium 14 - 18 april_2013 nashville , tennessee 1 introduction gamma - ray_burst ( grb ) afterglows occupy a unique position among the various high - energy astrophysical outflow phenomena . they are extremely relativistic blast_waves with inferred lorentz_factors γ that can_be over several_hundreds , far more_than those typical for active_galactic_nuclei ( γ ∼ 25 ) or microquasars ( γ ∼ 5 ) . they are transient_events that occur only once per source . and they are relatively ‘ clean ’ , certainly when compared to the prompt_emission , in that their outflows are ( at_least eventually ) not dominated_by complex large_scale magnetic_fields and in that their broadband_emission from radio to x - rays is dominated_by a single radiative process ( synchrotron_emission ) . this picture , of course , becomes_more murky the earlier one looks and the closer to the prompt_emission one_gets , and the more one looks in detail at the peculiarities of any given afterglow dataset . but broadly_speaking , the main conceptual_issues with_respect_to afterglow blast_waves are ( 1 ) the geometry and dynamics of the hydrodynamical outflow and the structure of its environment , ( 2 ) the microphysics of shock_acceleration of electrons and the generation of fields at the shock_front and ( 3 ) howBRwhich the particles are placed in a twodimensional experiment 3 , 6 , 16 , 17 . 3 . 2 . 1 inter - particle friction we start by discussing the case of inter - particle friction . the acting forces are as before , just now we consider the case of a finite friction_coefficient µ = 1 . with this choice , forces between contacting particles also act in the tangential_direction . moreover , these forces cannot_be derived_from a potential energy and depend_on the particle history . it is known that frictional_forces can have a rather strong influence on the rheological_behavior of dense particle systems . in granular suspensions , for example , interparticle friction leads to the dramatic_effect of discontinuous_shear_thickening 18 , 19 , where suspension_viscosity increases by orders of magnitude . here , friction destroys loop - reversibility , as is readily_apparent from fig . 3 . depicted is the trajectory of a test particle over a few_hundreds of cycles . we clearly see the slow evolution of nearly periodic cycles . thus , with the introduction of a history - dependent frictional_force , the particle motion is irreversible . interestingly , on long_times it is also diffusive . there is no glass - like regime , where particles would_be confined to cage - like regions . at first_sight this is unexpected , as the particle density is rather high , and way above the usual hardBRtv ] for a definition ) . such an object admits a cotangent_complex lx representing the functor of derivations over x . it is a quasi - coherent_sheaf over x . when x is locally of finite_presentation , its cotangent_complex is perfect and we can thus consider its dual , the tangent complex tx . we will prove the following statement . theorem 2 . 0 . 1 . let x be a derived_artin_stack locally of finite_presentation . then there is a lie_algebra UNK x over x whose_underlying module is equivalent to the shifted tangent complex txr ´_1s of x . moreover if f : x ñ y is a morphism between algebraic_stacks locally of finite_presentation then there is a tangent lie morphism UNK x ñ f UNK y . more_precisely , there is an 8 -
