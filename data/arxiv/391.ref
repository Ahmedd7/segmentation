( a ) the time averaged density of white_pixels is correlated with the position of the cytoskeleton at 37 ° c ( 1 . 05 tc ) . in the absence of cytoskeletal coupling ( inset ) the average density is trivially uniform . ( b ) the spatial_correlation function , g ( r ) , is not_significantly_altered by the presence of cytoskeletal coupling ( compare blue and red_dashed_lines ) . in each case g ( r ) decays over a correlation_length of roughly 20nm . in addition , the spatial cross - correlation_function between white_pixels and pinning_sites ( solid_line ) indicates that long_range correlations extend over roughly one correlation_length . ( c ) in a hypothetical ‘ generic ’ plasma_membrane not tuned to the proximity of a critical_point at 37 ° c , but instead with a critical_temperature of - 120_° c , the channels gathered by the cytoskeleton are much_thinner , and their contrast is diminished .
