network . these properties – called proof_obligations – are sufficient to ensure productivity . our_approach is to instantiate these proof_obligations for an_arbitrary xmas network . to achieve this objective , we need to encode the xmas semantics as an instance of the genoc theory . this encoding should reveal the proof_obligations that are sufficient to ensure productivity of an_arbitrary xmas network . a major_challenge is that the latest_version of the theory is not rich_enough to express the xmas semantics . of interest to this_paper is the issue that , currently , routing in genoc only depends_on the destination and the current position of a message . in xmas , as it will be explained_later in the paper , messages are routed according_to their content . for instance , routing_decisions depend_on the type of messages , e . g . , request or responses . the contribution of this_paper is an important_step_towards the extension of genoc and its instantiation for xmas . the important step presented in this_paper consists in the formalisation of a core subset of the xmas language in the context of the genoc formalism . the xmas language consists of eight primitives with well - defined semantics ( see next_section for more_details ) . ourBRa representation of the solution branch on which one is located . in our case , this winding would_be represented_by the number of cusps , while the different connected_components represent the solution branches . this “ duality ” will be reported separately . 7 . acknowledgements we_would_like to thank igor cherednikov and frederik van_der_veken for_useful_discussions and suggestions .

( 11 ) for θ µ ν . at the classical level we learn from eq . ( 11 ) that the trace θ = θ µ µ only gets contributions from the mass terms of actions . all dirac actions are linear in the masses ; hence their contributions to θ are just the 11 mass dependent terms in the action integrand , namely − mf ψ † γ ψ for each fermion . since we_are_primarily_interested in results in flat_spacetime we can take γ as the usual dirac matrix β = diag ( 1 , 1 , − 1 , − 1 ) . let_us break_up ψ into an upper 2 - spinor ψ and a lower one φ . thus ψ † γ ψ = ψ † ψ − φ † φ . as we_know from quantum_mechanics , the φ represents negative energy ( or antiparticle ) components , and for a nonrelativistic fermion it is small compared to ψ , so that ψ † γ ψ is evidently positive . this tells_us_that atomic and free electrons contribute_negatively to θ . but for a nucleon , in which the u and b quarks are evidently relativistic , the above argument is less credible . yet theBRsee that there are higher_order kdv terms with landau_damping term and its quantum correction . but since exact sech - solitary_wave_solution of a general higher_order kdv_equation of above form is possible only when ( coefficient of the term ∂ u ∂ ξ 3 ) , which is not present in ( 35 ) , hence the exact solitary_wave_solution of the higher_order kdv_equation and its decay due_to landau_damping terms cannot_be worked_out here . also it can_be seen that ( 35 ) contains 2 small parameters α 1 and q where α 2 , α 3 are assumed to be ≈ 1 . hence in the subsequent part of the work , the quantum correction terms and the landau_damping term are treated_as perturbation term to the kdv_equation . but since perturbation with multiple small parameters will include multiple time_scales in the calculation , hence it will be too_complicated to be_computed_analytically . in order to simplify the case and find out the nature of decay of the kdv solitary_wave amplitude we will assume_that α 1 ≈ α 2q . for example , in the case of hydrogen_plasma α 1 is approximately 0 . 025 and in [ 13 , 14 ] , the factor q is taken to be equal to be order of 0 . 01 . assuming this relation_between small parameters we can consider that the quantum correction to the landau_damping term which appears as the last_term of ( 35 ) is α 1 ≈ q2 , and hence it can_be neglected as small compared to the otherBR. 5 table 1 : bounds on eft couplings operator gx bound ot1 ot1 − 0 . 72 < gs < 0 . 21 1 . 77 < gs < 2 . 70 − 1 . 4 < gp < 1 . 4 λ / pfo [ gev ] > 537 150 − 185 > 208 since ggf is dominated_by a top_quark_loop , we can approximate an anomalous gs contribution to the observed rate by σ ( gg_→ h ) = κ 2 g × σ sm ( gg_→ h ) ≈ ( yt − gs ) 2 y2 t × σ sm ( gg_→ h ) , implying similarly , we can relate eq .
