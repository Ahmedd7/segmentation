invariant circle , there is an intersection between e and w over c . proof . the simplest situation is when w is locally a graph over the z coordinate and it is transverse to γ m . in this case , w ∩ e is locally_homeomorphic to e0 near ( 0 , m ) . the curves π − 1 1 ( c ) define a foliation of w \_{ ( 0 , m ) } by nested jordan_curves near ( 0 , m ) . since e0 is connected , we infer that all curves π − 1 1 ( c ) sufficiently_close to the origin intersect e and we are done . the argument is slightly_more_delicate when w is a graph tangent to γ m at ( 0 , m ) . let k be the order of contact between these two curves . by [ 2 , lemma 6 . 4 ] , for w 6 = m close to m , γ w intersects w transversely in exactly k points . there_exist local_coordinates ( x , y ) near ( 0 , m ) in which γ m = { y = 0 } and w = UNK y = xk UNK . as before , the point is to prove that π 1 ( e ∩ w ) is connected ( here the projection π 1 refers_to the new coordinates ) . by slodkowski ’_s theorem [ 22 ] , we extend the holomorphic motion to aBRand , therefore , avoiding those uncertainties . oscillating sphere 7 finally , we emphasize_again ( as done already earlier [ 5 ] ) : when the rapidly_growing lifetimes of the turbulent phases begin to exceed the time of observation , driven superfluid_turbulence appears to be stable , which is misleading because the lifetimes are large but finite and do_not_diverge . a similar result has_been_found in turbulent classical pipe_flow [ 15 ] . acknowledgements a discussion with my former co -

to - scalar_ratio . the not so small tensor - to - scalar_ratio can_easily distinguish the non - minimally_coupled quartic inflation , and possibly even determine the value of the non - minimal_coupling ξ . significant_improvement in ns measurement may distinguish r2 and higgs_inflation . another significant measurement is related to the analysis of the stability of the electroweak_vacuum . specifically , the higgs_inflation and light non - minimally_coupled inflation described in this talk are possible only if the electroweak_vacuum is absolutely_stable , while the r2 inflation may work even for a metastable one . the current higgs_boson_mass can_be compatible within experimental and theoretical errors with both stable and metastable electroweak_vacuum [ 15 , 28 ] . the most significant_improvement here may be measurement ofBRsin [ ϕ y ( x ) − ksdwx ] , 2 π β ( 2 ) here continuous x runs along the chain , and we have introduced the slowly -
