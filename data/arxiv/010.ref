this is unlike the previous three examples where the robust tests overcame a masking effect . these examples demonstrate that the robust dpd tests can give protection_against spurious conclusions in both directions . example 5 ( na intake data ) : sodium_chloride preference was determined in ten patients with essential_hypertension and in 12 normal volunteers . all exhibited normal detection and recognition thresholds for the taste of sodium_chloride . all were_placed on a constant dry diet containing 9 meq of na + and given , as their only source of fluids , a choice of drinking either 15 0 . 5 0 . 45 0 . 4 0 . 35 0 . 3 0 . 25 0 . 2 0 . 15 0 . 1 outlier_deleted_dataBRfollowing benchmark_problems provide exact_solution of problem 1 . 3 . 1 benchmark i : square domain , constant obstacle , nonzero dirichlet bc this benchmark is taken from [ 18 ] . let_us_consider a square domain ω = ( − 1 , 1 ) 2 and prescribe a contact radius r ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) . for loading f ( x , y ) = it can_be shown that u ( x , y ) = − 8 ( r4 + r2 ) + 8r2 ( x2 + y2 ) ______ − 16 ( x2 + y2 ) + 8r2 ______ UNK max_{ x2 + y2 − r2 , 0 } UNK 2 UNK x2 + y2 − r2 UNK 2 if UNK x2 + y2 > rBR2 ≃ l2 ( r , dv2 ) of the move 1 → 2 which is infinite_dimensional . similarly , for the move 0 → 2 there are no non - trivial quantum pre – and post – observables — in contrast to 1 → 2 . this provides an_explicit example for the discussion in sections 6 . 2 and 7 and illustrates_how the post – physical_hilbert_space and the dirac pre – and post – observables at a given time step depend_on the evolution move . − hphys and + hphys can_be regarded_as representing a unique physical vacuum_state without propagating_degrees of freedom . 2 0 9 remarks on the special situation in simplicial gravity models so_far we have considered general variational discrete systems . however , even apart_from the fact that euclidean configuration_spaces q ≃ rn are not appropriate for quantum_gravity models ( euclidean here does_not refer to the space - time signature ) , there are a number of special properties of gravity one has to take_into_account when adapting the present formalism to a simplicial gravity model . the situation in gravity is special for many reasons . classically , the dynamics and diffeomorphism_symmetry of the continuum theory is generated_by the hamiltonian and diffeomorphism constraints . the dirac hypersurface deformation algebra of these constraints implies a path independence of the evolution between an initial and final spatial_hypersurface [ 62 ] . this constraint structure also entails that in quantum_gravity there is no ( coordinate ) time_evolution and physical states are a priori ‘BR, e λ ) ( 1 + z ) 1 − η . ef ( z ) . e ϕ ( z ) dist ( z , e λ ) ( 1 + z ) η , z ∈ c . sequence and put thus , ef < f ∞ ϕ , whileef / ( · − λ ) ∈ f ∞ ϕ , λ ∈ e λ . also , ifefg ∈ f ∞ ϕ , then g ( z ) . z1 − η / dist ( z , e λ ) , whence g ≡ 0 . thus , e λ is a uniqueness set for f ∞ ϕ . it_remains to show thate λ is an interpolating_sequence for f ∞ ϕ . let ( vn ) n ≥ 0 be a finite ef ( z ) ef ′ ( λ n ) ( z − λ n ) ef ′ ( λ n ) ( γ m − λ n ) UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK ef ( γ m ) since we_already_know that γ is a sampling sequence for f ∞ ϕ , we have k fvk ϕ , ∞ ≍ sup γ m ∈ e γ fv ( z ) = xn ( 23 ) = sup vn . vn e − ϕ ( γ m ) UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK xn vne − ϕ ( λ n ) bn , m UNK UNK UNK UNK , γ m ∈ e γ UNK UNK UNK UNK xn sampling , interpolation and riesz_bases in small fock_spaces 23 where bn , m = e ϕ ( λ n ) − ϕ ( γ m ) ef ( γ m ) . bn , m = e ϕBRinstant energy functional e h and the dissipation_rates dn ( ¯ v ( t ) ) , dh n ( ¯ v ( t ) ) by 10 ( 3 . 8 ) _______________ _______________  ( 3 . 11 ) and ( 3 . 12 ) en ( ¯ v ( t ) ) = x α ≤ nzr3 + κ 1 x α ≤ n − 1 − κ 3 x α ≤ n − 2 n ( ¯ v ( t ) ) = x1 ≤ α ≤ nzr3 e h + κ 1 x1 ≤ α ≤ n − 1 − κ 3 x1 ≤ α ≤ n − 2 ( 1 + σ st + φ ( σ st ) ) ( ∂ α ¯ σ 2 + ∂ α ¯BR2 ) µ ij = − gmimj ϕ orij g is newton_’_s constant and ϕ o is a constant scaling_factor , equal to the gravitational background potential of the universe . ϕ j ( ri ) denotes the potential due_to mj at the position of mi . the definition of inertia ( 2 ) satisfies the relational principle ; it vanishes at infinite separation and both inertia and kinetic_energy are defined as mutual , frame independent properties between each pair of bodies , just_like the force of gravity and potential energy . classical gravitational_potential_energy between the two bodies can_be expressed_as vij = − gmimj rij = µ ij ϕ o . ( 3 ) hence , inertia is potential energy , thus giving interpretation to the mass - energy equivalence . furthermore , the correct prediction of relativistic trajectories consistently requires [ 5 ] ( 4 ) the total energy of an isolated system of point masses is straightforwardly the sum_over all pairs ϕ o = − 1 2c2 . e = UNK UNK tij + vij = UNK UNK ij + µ ij ϕ o = UNK UNK 1 2 µ ij r2 1 2 µ ij ( r2 ij − c2 ) .
