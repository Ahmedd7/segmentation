at time t . such a map ( t , x ) 7 → r ( t , x ) associating with time and position a celerity is called a traffic regulator , feeding traffic celerities to mobile ’_s velocities . we thus reserve the word velocity ξ ′ ( t ) to the mobiles which governs 11 their evolution by the cinematic law ∀ t , ξ ′ ( t ) = r ( t , ξ ( t ) ) ( 1 ) and the word celerity r ( t , p ) as an information attached to the position p at time t of the network , independent of the actual mobile passing_through ξ ( t ) = p at position p at time t using this information provided by the traffic regulator . for instance , if the mobile is governed_by its_own dynamical second - order_differential_equation x ′ ′ ( t ) = g ξ ( t , ξ ( t ) , ξ ′ ( t ) ) , then its actual evolution on the network is governed_by the second - order equation ∀ t ,BRestimate of the maximum polar_angle fluctuations of the easy direction that would still not destabilize the system and is given by h θ 2i = c0 / a2 . ℓ / a . this is a reasonable_assumption since ℓ / a can take a wide_range of non - zero values for a finite anchoring . we therefore expect that the requirements for the positivity of the effective extrapolation length , giving_rise_to a stable solution in the presence of disorder , holds in most realistic_situations . while characteristic properties of disorder induced interactions in confined lcs are similar to the general behavior found in systems with monopolar charge disorder in the context of em casimir_effect or coulomb fluids [ 16 – 23 ] , our results nevertheless show a fundamental difference_between this latter_case and the confined lcs . the easy direction disorder turns_out_to become_important in general only in an intermediate range of intersurface separations – or , in other_words , for intermediate strength of the anchoring energy – and becomes_negligible ( relative to the pseudo - casimir contribution ) both for very_small and very_large separations . this is obviously contrary to the behavior of a disordered coulomb system , where the effects of charge disorder become gradually more_important as the disorder builds_up and eventually dominate at large_separations . our results thus clearly point to differences_between the disorder effects in these two_types of systems that are both characterized_by critical correlations . the disorder effects are therefore not portable outside the exact nature of the system even if thermal and disorder correlations have the same_qualitative_behavior . acknowledgments r . p . acknowledges arrs grants j1 - 4297 and p1 - 0055 .
