( 2013 ) we presented a first estimate of the location of leo p on the btfr as calibrated by mcgaugh ( 2012 ) . with the present analysis , we are now able_to place leo p on this plot with confidence . in figure 10 we thus show two reproductions of the btfr from mcgaugh ( 2012 ) . figure 10 ( a ) shows leo p ( turquoise square ) amongst all of the galaxies from mcgaugh ( 2012 ) ; red_circles are star - dominated galaxies , green_triangles are gas - rich_galaxies , and – 17 – blue_squares are dsph_galaxies . figure 10 ( b ) shows the same data , but with the dsph_galaxies removed ( see discussion above and in mcgaugh & wolf 2010 and stringer et_al . 2010 ) and the dynamic_range compressed for ease of interpretation . the shaed grey_line_shows the ± 1 σ regression to the properties of the gas - dominated galaxies derived in mcgaugh ( 2012 ) . the position of leo p on the btfr plots isBRis a hybrid switching jump_diffusion , i . e . , a markov_process with hybrid state space and jumps where the discrete state changes can_be seen as switches that takes the diffusion from a mode to another . we have shown that the stochastic_differential_equations that characterize this process 22 0204060800 . 000 . 050 . 100 . 150 . 20place enumber of moleculessimulationhybrid sdehybrid ode1002003004005006007000 . 0000 . 0040 . 008place pnumber of moleculessimulationhybrid sdehybrid ode can_be derived automatically both from the description of the original markov_chains or starting_from a higher level description language , like stochastic_petri_nets . to support our_proposal , we have applied the method for the analysis of two well - established models , one describing viral_infection kinetics and the other transcription_regulation . the results obtained with our method closelyBR. taylor , 2 v . k . anand , 2 r . p . singh , 1 m . r . lees , 1 e . a . goremychkin , 2 , 4 m . m . koza , 3 v . v . krishnamurthy , 5 d . m . paul , 1 and g . balakrishnan1 , ‡_1department of physics , university of warwick , coventry_cv4_7al , united_kingdom 2isis facility , stfc , rutherford_appleton_laboratory , chilton , didcot , oxfordshire_ox11_0qx , united_kingdom 3institut laue_langevin , bp 156 , 38042_grenoble_cedex_9 , france 4school of physics and astronomy , university of southampton , southampton_so17_1bj , united_kingdom 5school of physics , astronomy and computational_sciences , george_mason_university , fairfax , virginia 22030 , usa ( dated_:_october 1 , 2013 ) the magnetic states of the non - centrosymmetric , pressure induced superconductor cecoge3 have_been_studied with magnetic_susceptibility , muon_spin_relaxation ( µ sr ) , single_crystal neutron_diffraction and inelastic_neutron_scattering ( ins ) . cecoge3 exhibits three magnetic_phase_transitions at tn1 = 21 k , tn2 = 12 k and tn3 = 8 k . the presence of long_range magnetic order below tn1 is revealed by the observation of oscillations of the asymmetry in the µ sr spectra between 13 k and 20 k and a sharp_increase in the muon depolarization_rate . single_crystal neutron_diffraction_measurements reveal magnetic_bragg_peaks consistent_withBRusing the above mass parameter restrictions and flow = 40hz . we then computed the fittings factors of this template_bank towards aligned spin signals in the same m1 − m2 parameter_space . in fig . 1a , we show that a template_bank with χ = 0 already captures greater_than 97 % of the possible snr over a wide mass and spin range . in particular , we note_that the χ = 0 bank covers signals with χ < 0 down to roughly χ ∼ − 0 . 25 over the entire mass range . from astrophysical considerations of binary evolution , spins positively aligned with the orbital_angular_momentum are considered the more_likely scenario for binary_black_holes [ 8 ] . given these factors , along with the potential for artifacts in the waveforms at large negative χ , we develop our search using only χ ≥ 0 templates . note_that since χ is a mass - weighted_sum of the two component spins , this restriction does_not_necessarily exclude the possibility that one of the black_holes has an anti - aligned spin . we also see that as the total mass of the target system increases , the fractional loss of snr incurred from neglecting spin decreases . this effect is due_to the fact that higher mass systems merge at lower_frequencies and have fewer cycles in the ligo sensitive band and consequently the matched_filtering is more tolerant of imperfect templates . we thus expect that for systems with total masses exceeding mtotal = 35m UNK , the benefits ofBR) 2 ( a2 l + a2 r ) ( 34 ) the discussion of loop induced decays for the four configurations of higgses can_be divided_into_two_categories : 1 ) hd localized_near the uv brane . this case corresponds_to configurations a and c discussed in section [ ii ] . for this case let_us_first consider the contribution due_to the exchange of neutral_scalar states in the loop as shown in the left_panel of fig .
