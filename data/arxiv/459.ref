channel cognitive_radio_networks was considered . in [ 12 ] , the problem of quickest_detection of idle channels over k independent channels was_studied . the idle / busy state of each channel was assumed fixed over time , and the objective was to minimize the detection delay under error constraints . it was shown that the optimal_policy is to carry_out an independent sprt over each channel , irrespective of the testing order . in contrast to [ 12 ] , we show in this_paper that the optimal_policy in our model highly depends_on the testing order even when the processes are independent . in [ 13 ] , the problem of identifying the first abnormal sequence among an_infinite number of i . i . d sequences was considered . an optimal cumulative_sum ( cusum ) test was_established under this setting . variations of the latter model have_been_studied in [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] . the sequential search problem under the exclusive model was_investigated in [ 16 ] – [ 19 ] . optimal_policies were derived for the problem of quickest search over weiner processes [ 16 ] – [ 18 ] . it was shown in [ 16 ] ,BRw ) with node -
