( note_that we regard ∞ as 1 / 0 . ) the condition we have to check is that each of edgepaths in γ s uses only one of the three_types . then we see that δ 1 ( respectively , δ 2 , δ 3 ) uses only the edges of type h odd odd i ( resp . h odd even i − h even odd i ) . it_follows that γ s satisfies the first condition . the second condition which we have to check is that γ s contains even number of edgepaths with penultimate vertices corresponding to odd - integers . here , for type iii edgepaths , penultimate vertices mean the vertices on the vertical v - axis . actually we see that δ 1 and δ 3 have the penultimate vertices h − 1i and h1i , which odd i , h odd even i − h odd even i − h odd 6 kazuhiro_ichihara correspond_to odd_integers , while δ 2 has the penultimate vertex h0i , which does an even integers . it_follows that γ s satisfies the second condition . to calculate the twists , it_suffices_to count the number of increasing / decreasing edges in γ s . actually we see that the number of increasing ( respectively decreasing ) edges in γ s is just n ( resp . 2 ) . thus the twist τ ( γ s ) = − 2 ( n − 2 ) = 4 − 2n . UNK now let_us_giveBRas an efimov state . triggered by this interesting fact , several investigations of the helium_trimer have_been produced , establishing that its excited_state is indeed an efimov - like state ( see for example refs . [ 8 – 10 ] ) . in addition , analysis of the atom - dimer collision in the ultracold_regime have_also_been performed [ 11 – 13 ] . one of the main_difficulties in solving the quantum_mechanical problem in the case of three helium_atoms results to be the treatment of the strong_repulsion at_short_distances of the he - he potential . specific algorithms_have_been_developed so_far to solve this problem . the faddeev_equation has_been opportunely modified [ 14 ] . moreover , the hyperspherical adiabatic ( ha )BR, the effective_mass m ∗ diverges and eq .

( 8 ) are represented_by some universal function of variables t , b , x . in that case m ∗ strongly_depends_on the same variables . in contrast to the landau quasiparticle paradigm assuming the constancy of the effective_mass , the extended quasiparticle paradigm is to be introduced [ 5 ] . the main point here is that the well - defined quasiparticles determine as before the thermodynamic , relaxation and transport_properties of strongly_correlated fermi - systems , while m ∗ becomes a function of t , b , x , etc . 2 . 1 . scaling_behavior of both the effective_mass and hf metals a deeper_insight_into the behavior of m ∗ ( t , b ) can_be achieved using some ” internal ” scales . namely , near fcqpt the solutions of eq .
