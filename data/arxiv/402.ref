( 9 ) , which gives_rise_to a term that plays the role of a coulomb - like potential , vanishes . besides , the energy_levels of the bound_states ( 16 ) could not be achieved if we have considered the non - null components of the tensor qij being , for instance , q ρ ϕ = q ϕ ρ 6 = 0 and the field given in eq . ( 5 ) . in this case , the term UNK ~ q × ~ b UNK · ~ p present in eq . ( 3 ) does_not_induce a coulomb - type term , thus , no bound_states solutions analogous to having a quantum particle confined to a coulomb_potential can_be achieved . hence , the arising of the coulomb - type potential in eq .
