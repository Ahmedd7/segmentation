dashed_line_shows the exclusion_limit for the ewpd is marked with solid_lines . the region allowed by the current bound on the m → eg br ( m → eg ) < 10 − 14 . the scatter points correspond_to different values of the maximum neutrino_yukawa_coupling y : y = 0 . 001 ( blue ◦ ) , ii ) y = 0 . 01 ( green + ) , iii ) y = 0 . 1 ( red × ) , iv ) y = 1 ( orange ♦ ) and v ) an_arbitrary value of the yukawa_coupling y ≤ 1 ( cyan points ) . as depicted in fig . 1 , in the case of a light_neutrino_mass spectrum with inverted_hierarchy a strong_suppression of the m → eg decay_rate is possible for specific values of the measured neutrino_oscillation_parameters . this is due_to cancellations in the m − e transition amplitude proportional to um 2 + ium 1 which are possible in the case of neutrino_mass_spectrum withBRusing a ccd_camera ( dcu223m , thorlabs , 1024x768 pixels , 4 . 65 - µ m pixel_size ) to collect the light at the output . figure 5 ( a ) displays different sections , normalized at their peaks , corresponding to different pump mean power values . first of all , we observe_that the spectrum of the pump turns_out_to be ∼ 1 nm_wide , despite the longer pulse_duration of the non - transform - limited pump_beam . secondly , we note_that both the dips in the sections of panel ( a ) and the progressive appearance of a central hole in the contour_plots shown in panels ( b ) - ( d ) are a clear_signature of pump_depletion . the sections of the spatial profiles presented in fig . 5 ( e ) and normalized at their area were_obtained by taking 1 : 1 images of the pump_beam at the output of the crystal with the same dcu223m camera at different values of the power . also in this case a clear dip occurs . it becomes_broader and deeper as the pump mean power increases . its generation is initially slightly lateral with_respect_to the center because of the pump_beam walk - off inside the crystal [ see panels ( f ) - ( h ) ] . the depletion of the pump is also responsible_for the evolution of the total_number of photons generated in each realization of the pdc process . in fig . 6 we plot the mean number of photons detected in an area close to frequency degeneracy and in the quasi - collinear interaction geometry as a function of the square_root of the pump peak power per_pulse . to obtain this result , we have taken_into_account the calibration of theBRacross a region in which the shock_waves are moving in only one direction . these regions are therefore a piece of the btz - vaidya_spacetime , with mass profile determined in appendix b . 3 ensembles in the previous_section we have discussed a family of geometries with long wormholes , in particular , by taking describing weak correlation_between the left and right cfts . 13 btzvaidyavaidyavaidyabtzvaidyads2 = -

diagonal_elements such as vub be known to high_precision . there is a long - standing tension_between the value of vub determined from exclusive and inclusive methods . to address this challenge , it is important to improve_upon the existing lattice calculations as_well as the experimental_measurements [ 4 ] . in particular , the quantity f + from lattice_qcd has_not_been updated ( in the peer - reviewed literature ) since 2008 [ 3 ] . recently , several efforts ( including this one ) from different lattice collaborations [ 5 ] have_been aiming to improve the determination of f + with new data ( better statistics , smaller lattice_spacings and smaller light_quark_masses ) and improved theoretical methods . another topic that motivates this calculation is the rare b → π UNK + UNK − decay , which is loop - suppressed in the sm , and therefore sensitive to new_physics . the low - energy effective operators that contribute to this process in the sm are the flavor - changing vector and tensor currents . lattice calculations of vector and tensor form_factors for this process are timely , since first experimental_measurements have_already_appeared [ 6 ] . thus , the calculation of ft is also a focus of this analysis . 2 . latticeBR0 . 77 − 3 . 46 ) table 7 : numerical values of the differential_branching_ratio in gev − 2 for different intervals of q2 ( gev 2 ) for λ b → λ τ + τ − decay_channel in sm and tc2 models obtained using the typical values of the masses m π + = 450_gev and mz ′ = 1500_gev . t previously_observed by the cdf and lhcb_collaborations . • as it is expected , the value of the branching_ratio decreases with increasing the mass of the final lepton . • in the case of µ channel , the experimental_data on the branching_ratio coincide_with the interval predicted by the sm within the errors ,BRof the thirty -
