UNK i we may compare this with the case of a fibration : let f : y → w be a holomorphic_fibration onto a curve of genus_greater_than one . then w is a k ( g , 1 ) , hence z = h 2 ( w , z ) ≃ h 2 ( π 1 ( w ) , z ) . we obtain a natural_morphism h 2 ( w , z ) → h 2 ( π 1 ( y ) , z ) . it maps the cohomology of a point pBR, such that their length is much_greater_than the coherence_length of the superconducting_film ( which does_not_exceed 100 a ) . the theory of the transition to resistive ( normal ) state for single long and short film bridges placed in liquid_helium or vacuum has_been most fully_developed by skocpol , beasley , and tinkham ( sbt theory ) . 8 the analysis based_on this theory gives reason to believe_that for the heat 4 w , dissipation in the resistive bridge equal to about 10 which is typical for our experimental situation , their resistivity in helium vapor corresponds_to the normal state . in the sbt theory , the emergence of normal resistance in such bridges is associated_with the occurrence of the so - called hot_spots in bridges upon_reaching the critical_current . the size of such spot in a bridge , the normal regionBRhas lower conductance score than n ( v ) for any other neighbor v of u [ 15 ] . for a node u ′ belonging_to such a locally minimal neighborhood k , we initialize fu ′ k = 1 if u ′ has an outgoing_edge ( or fu ′ k = 0 otherwise ) , and set hu ′ k = 1 if u ′ has an incoming_edge ( or hu ′ k = 0 otherwise ) . choosing the number of communities . to automatically determine the number of communities k , we follow the approach proposed in [ 3 ] . we divide all node pairs into 80_% training and 20 % test set . varying k , we fit codaBRt ) where : t β = ( ( s β , r β , pre β ) , t β ) . act where τ ( α ) = m α s = s α ∪ s β ∪_{ ¯ t t ∈ t α ∪ t β } ra = r α ra = r α a ∪_{ ( ¯ t , ¯ u ) t , u ∈ t α ∪ t β } for a ∈ b a ∪ [ a ∪ r β a ∪ r β ( { ¯ t } ∪ t ( r α a ∪ r β a ) ) 2 for a / ∈ b t ∈ t α ∪ t β pre = pre α ∪ pre β ∪_{ ( ¯ t , ( pre α ∪ pre β ) ( t ) ) t ∈ t α ∪ t β } t = { ¯ t t ∈ t α } lemma 4 . 14 let α ∈BRlattice , the wavefunction of the system at time t can_be written n0i . substituting this wavefunction into the schrodinger_equation leads to the following equation : as ψ ( t ) i = pn n ψ n ( t ) c † i ∂ ∂ t ψ n ( t ) = − j ( ψ n + 1 ( t ) + ψ n − 1 ( t ) ) + v cos ( 2 π α n + δ ) ψ n ( t ) . ( 2 ) here , ψ n ( t ) is the probability amplitude of finding the excitation at site n . for irrational α , it is shown that a localization transition appears in the a - a model as v is increased beyond the critical_value ( v = 2j ) with all states being extended ( localized ) for v < 2j ( v > 2j ) . for rational α , the a - a model can_be mapped_into a 2d hofstadter lattice by treating δ as the momentum of another spatial_dimension [ 16 , 17 ] . for α 6 = 1 2 , the hofstadter lattice has gapped energy_bands with non - trivial topology , characterized_by non - zero chern_numbers . thus localized edge_states are expected for a finite - size system with boundary . iii . results to simulate numerically the quantum evolution of the system , we choose two different initial states . in the first , the system is initially_prepared to occupy site 1 , while in the second , the system is initializedBRto classify polynomials in f2n [ x ] that induce apn functions on infinitely_many extensions of f2n [ 15 ] , [ 1 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 3 ] . let f ∈ fq [ x ] and define the polynomial f ( x , y , w ) to be ( 5 ) f ( x + w ) − f ( x ) − f ( y + w ) + f ( y ) ( x − y ) w when q is odd , and ( 6 ) f ( x + w ) + f ( x ) + w x + f ( y + w ) + f ( y ) + w y ( x + y ) w when q is even . it is a direct_consequence of the definition of planar functions that , if f induces a planar function on fqr , then all fqr - rational zeros of f satisfy x = y or w = 0 . the strategy is to show that f has an absolutely_irreducible factor over_fq , since then , for all sufficiently_large r , the polynomial f has many fqr - rational zeros by the lang - weil_bound [ 10 ] , so that f cannot_be planar on fqr . to do_so , we useBRfunction defined in lemma 3 . ( 11 ) UNK it can_be routinarily checked that , once the excluded apex graph h is fixed , the dependance on r of the multiplicative_constant involved in the upper_bound of equation ( 11 ) is of the form 222o ( r · log r ) , that is , it depends triple - exponentially on the integer r . explicit linear kernels via dynamic_programming 21 5 an_explicit linear kernel for r - scattered set let r UNK 1 be a fixed integer . given a graph g and a set s ⊆ v ( g ) , we say that s is an r - independent set if any two vertices in s are at distance greater_than r in g . we define the r - scattered set problem , which can_be seen as a generalization of independent set , as follows . r - scattered set instance : a graph g and a non - negative_integer k . parameter : the integer k . question : does g have a 2r - independent set of size at_least k ? our encoder for r - scattered set ( or_equivalently , for r - independent set ) is inspired from the proof of fomin et_al .
