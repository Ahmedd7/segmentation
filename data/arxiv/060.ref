( 6 ) UNK n ∈ filled UNK π − π 1 2 π here , p1 is a projection_operator projecting on the site 1 component . as far as t + = t − , ρ 1 ( k UNK ) = 0 . 5 holds in our model by a symmetrical reason . consequently , θ type 1 ( k UNK ) and θ type 2 ( k UNK ) differ by π . intuitive_understanding of this bulk – edge correspondence is possible with the help of adiabatic continuation when θ ( k UNK ) is quantized . we briefly_explain thisBRa projective_module which one may call the tangent_bundle of the corresponding noncommutative_geometry . furthermore , an analogue of the riemannian_connection can_be found and the corresponding 1 2 joakim arnlind scalar_curvatures are computed . note_that our_approach is in principle not limited to surfaces , and can_be applied to noncommutative_algebras corresponding to submanifolds of any dimension . 2 . poisson algebraic formulation of surface geometry in [ ahh12 ] it was shown that the geometry of embedded riemannian_manifolds can_be reformulated in terms of multi - linear brackets of the embedding coordinates ; moreover , in the case of almost kahler_manifolds , a poisson_bracket formulation can_be obtained [ ah11 ] . let_us_recall the basic_facts of this reformulation , in the case of embedded surfaces . let ( σ , g ) be a 2 - dimensional_riemannian_manifold , and let θ be a poisson_bivector defining the bracket { f , h } = θ ab UNK ∂ af UNK UNK ∂ bh UNK . for f , h ∈ c ∞ ( σ ) . on a 2 - dimensional_manifold , every poisson_bivector is of the form θ ab = ε ab / ρ for some density ρ ( where ε 12 = − ε 21 = 1 ) . the cofactor expansion of the inverse of a matrix gives the following way of writing the inverse of the metric ( 2 . 1 ) which , upon setting γ = √ g / ρ , becomes γ 2gab = θ ap θ bqgab . ε ap ε bqgab = ⇒ gab = gab = θ ap θ bqgab , 1 g ρ 2 g nowBR+ 1 ) energies ( top ) and s2n ( bottom ) as a function of neutron number . note_that we plot these against decreasing neutron number so that the deformed_nuclei are on the left and spherical ones on the right to make the comparison with fig . 5 easier . note also that the overall_trend in s2n is opposite from that in fig . 5 since s2n values decrease with increasing neutron number ( going to the left in fig . 9 ( bottom ) which simply_reflects the filling of the shell model orbits . the noticeable deviation occurs near n ∼ 90 where there is a distinct flattening . to correlate the trends in these two observables in the n = 90 region , one can use the same interpretation as above for w at n = 116 , namely , if there is a visible change at neutron number n in e ( 2 + 1 ) and there are many valence_nucleons , we expect to see a change in the behavior of s2n . in fig . 9 ( top ) , the e ( 2 + 1 ) change occurs at n ∼ 90 . the isotope 62sm at n = 90 has np = 12 and nn = 8 so it has 10 bosons and its p - factor is 4 . 8 ( see fig . 7 ) . one therefore expects to see a change in s2n . fig . 9 ( bottom ) confirms this expectation . the clear structural change at n = 90 shown in e ( 2 + 1 ) is correlated with a larger binding compared to the general_trend inBRproblem is set up properly . assessing the effect of the success_probability might require the sort of statistical_analysis given in sec . v . d3 : compare the performance of probabilistic protocols with deterministic protocols , using the same performance metric for all cases . if possible , compare with the optimal deterministic protocol , which sets a quantum limit on estimation as measured by the chosen performance metric . the analysis we present in secs . ii – v adheres to these desiderata by considering single - parameter_estimation , with mse as the performance metric and the corresponding quantum_cram_´_er - rao_bound setting the quantum limit on achievable mse . the string of inequalities in our theorem automatically includes the probabilities for favorable outcomes and the overall success_probability p ( UNK x ) in just the right way for comparing probabilistic and deterministic_strategies . in contrast , in much previous_work , the relative scarcity of the favorable outcomes and / or the failure to garner any information_about the parameters from the discarded outcomes is not fully included in the analysis , thus making it difficult to judge the impact of discarding outcomes . though our analysis provides aBR. 026 / 0 . 028 0 . 119 / 0 . 098 0 . 952 / 0 . 196 55 . 6 % 90_% 85 . 7 % success 0 / 0 . 03 success this experiment still produced profitable trades on average throughout the trading_period though less profitable than simply not rebalancing . we think this can largely contributed to forcibly closing out all trades at the end of 2006 . cross_validation cross_validation was_performed on the second half of our cleaned data . the formation period was set from 2008 through 2009 and the trading_period lasted from 2010 through 2011 . portfolios identified average # of stocks per portfolio portfolios passed johansen test portfolios that produce a net positive profit during formation period portfolios that produce a net positive profit during trading_period total # of trades during trading_period total # of trades that produce a net positive profit during trading_period average net_profit per trade average net_profit per portfolio total net_profitBRhave small angles between_them and a large angle with a4 . in this case , we replace a4 with its reflection in the origin which causes two of the angles θ 14 and θ 24 to undergo the transformation θ → π − θ . this creates a more_complicated transformation of the chsh_inequalities eqs . ( 3 . 3 ) - ( 3 . 6 ) in which again the upper and lower_bounds are interchanged , but also some of the chsh_inequalities are interchanged with each_other . again we_get back to situations similar to those depicted in figures 1 and 2 . 9 these arguments can_be repeated for other orientations of the vectors and this will involve the other chsh_inequalities . we thus establish in a simple geometric way that the parameters of this local_hidden_variables model , the four vectors , may be chosen in such a way that any set of values of the four correlation_functions may be matched , as long as the correlation_functions satisfy the chsh_inequalities , and eq . ( 3 . 1 ) is the solution to the matching problem . this therefore proves sufficiency in fine ’_s theorem . iv . the bell case turning now to the algebraic proof , we consider first a simpler example , namely that in which we seek a probability p ( s1 , s2 , s3 ) matching the three marginals p ( s1 , s2 ) , p ( s2 , s3 ) and p ( s1 , s3 ) . the probabilityBRnorman baker . the main_goal of their studies was an attempt to find an excitation mechanism for the β_cephei pulsations . wojtek was the first to develop a computer_code for linear nonadiabatic nonradial_oscillations . he obtained instability for realistic models of some classical variables like δ_scuti_stars but not for the β_cephei - type variables . the results were never_published , and much_later , at iau_symposium 162 in france in 1993 , wojtek wrote in retrospect : “ for many_years , explaining the cause of β_cephei variability has_been a major_challenge to stellar_pulsation theory . the problem is now solved , but we owe the solution to progress in opacity calculation and not to new astrophysical ideas . in fact , if the opal_opacities were available , the problem would_have_been solved many_years_ago ( baker &_dziembowski 1969 , unpublished ) ” (BRto check UNK g ( uk ) uk + 1 = f + q ( uk , bduk ) , i . e . uk + 1 = sg ( uk ) that UNK uk UNK x s , α ≤ r for all k . for k = 0 , this is clear ; for k > 0 , we_deduce from ( 8 . 15 ) and ( 8 . 12 ) that ( 8 . 16 ) b UNK uk + 1 UNK x s , α ≤ cs ≤ cs UNK UNK f UNK h s − 1 , α UNK r ( c − 1 b + lq ( r ) UNK uk UNK x s , α s − lq ( r ) ) + lq ( r ) r UNK = r . UNK since { uk } ⊂ x s , α is bounded in a separable_hilbert_space , we can extract a subsequence , which we continue to call uk , that converges_weakly : uk UNK u ∈ x s , α . since the inclusion x s , α → x s − 0 , α − 0 is compact , we then also have strong_convergence uk → u in x s − 0 , α − 0 . then we have by the continuity assumption ( 8 . 10BR16 ] proposes a tracking framework integrating multiple trackers based_on different feature_descriptors . all trackers are run in parallel . the output of each tracker is associated_with a probability representing its quality . the framework selects the tracker corresponding to the highest probability for computing the tracking output . both approaches require the execution of different trackers in parallel which is expensive in terms of processing time . moreover the studies [ 6 , 10 ] take only into_account the appearance variation of an object over time , but not tracking issues due_to similar appearance of their neighboring objects . in this_paper , we_propose a new object_tracking approach overcoming the above limitations . the proposed strategy selects an_appropriate tracker among an appearance tracker and a klt_tracker for each mobile object to obtain the best tracking_performance . this helpsBRand after exiting the molecular guide exhibited different rotational_temperatures , 18 we must assume_that rotational distributions of ch3f molecules before and after entering the electric_field region are also different . assuming trot = 20 k for ch3f molecules immediately following the supersonic_expansion , then over 95_% of molecules reside in j ≤ 5 levels . more_importantly , over 60 % of ch3f molecules occupy the k = 0 state , whilst the remaining ≈ 40 % fraction of molecules are in 3 ≤ k ≤ 1 states . methyl fluoride molecules in j ≥ 1 , k = 0 rotational_levels exhibit only a quadratic stark_effect , and are therefore expected to be guided less efficiently
