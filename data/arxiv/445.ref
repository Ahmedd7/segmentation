current , which may increase the ac loss . for their design , it is necessary to understand and predict the ac loss . this_article analises the ac loss in magnet - like coils under dc_bias contribution super - imposed to the ac current . the analyses is based_on a numerical model that takes the interaction_between magnetization currents in all turns into_account . the studied example is a stack of 32 pancake_coils with 200 turns each made of thin tape , such as rebco coated_conductor . we present the current_density , the instantaneous power loss , and loss per_cycle . we have found that the loss increases with the dc_bias current . the instantaneous power loss is the largest in the initial rise of the the ac current . in following cycles , the power loss is higher in the current increase than in the decrease . the loss per_cycle is the largest at the end pancakes . in conclusion , the highest cooling power should_be supplied to the top and bottom pancakes and during current rise , specially the initial one . the presentedBRk \ ℓ 2 3 4 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 27 123 75 39 13 3 3 0 0 0 1 2752 951 257 29 2 0 0 0 0 0 3835 829 145 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 . 3 hardly extendable subsets many partial results towards the solution of the č_ern_ý_conjecture uses the so - called extension method [ 10 , 16 , 21 , 8 ] . this method is to look for a sequence of ( short ) words w1 , . . . , wn − 1 such that s1 = { q } for some q ∈ q , and sk + 1 = skw − 1 k with sk + 1 ≥ sk for k ≥ 1 . then , necessarily , sn = q , and the word wn − 1 . . . w2w1 is synchronizing . in other_words , we try to extend subsets of q , starting_from a singleton , rather that to compress subsets starting_from q . in connection with this method we say that s ⊆ q is m - extendable if there is a word w of length at_most m with sw − 1 ≥ s . for example , for automata whose_underlying digraph is eulerian , kari [ 16 ] proved that any subset is n - extendable . this implies that such automata satisfy the č_ern_ý_conjecture . unfortunately , it is not true , in general , that each subset in each synchronizing_automaton is nextendable . in [ 7 ]BRhill b , middlebrook n , poole c , oborn b and langton c . commissioning of a geant4 based treatment_plan simulation tool : linac model and dicom - rt interface . http_:_/ / eprints . qut . edu . au / 41556 / . 6 . jan s et_al . , gate v6 : a major enhancement of the gate simulation_platform enabling modelling of ct and radiotherapy . phys . med . biol . 56 ( 2011 ) 881 - 901 . 7 . jan s et_al . , gate : a simulation_toolkit for pet and spect . phys . med . biol . 49 ( 2004 ) 4543 - 4561 . 8 . strul d , santin g , lazaro d , breton v , morel c . gate ( geant4 application for tomographic emission ) : a pet / spect general - purpose simulation_platform . nucl . phys . b ( proc . suppl . ) 125 ( 2003 ) 75 - 79 . 9 . santin g , strul d , lazaro d , simon l , krieguer m , vieira m , breton v , morel c .BRto nuclear_recoils from elastic_scattering , up - scattering , and down - scattering , while indirectdetection experiments will potentially be able_to measure fluxes from dark - matter self - annihilation , dark - matter co - annihilation , and dark - matter decay . likewise , collider_experiments will potentially involve dark - matter production which is both symmetric and asymmetric . of course , neither inelastic down - scattering nor dark - matter decay will be relevant for present - day experiments unless the more_massive dark - matter components have significant cosmological abundances at the present time ; indeed , this already places one set of constraints on their decay_widths . in this connection , we also note_that this sameBRsketched below . next we support our_proposal by computing numerically some of the observables above . we consider cylindrical networks of length l = 400 ( with reflecting_boundary_conditions ) and eight different circumferences w ∈ { 19 , 22 , . . . , 40 } . we use eq .
