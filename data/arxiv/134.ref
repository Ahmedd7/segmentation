( 1 ) by algebraizing formal brauer elements and using a relative form of the artintate isomorphism , one can produce families of supersingular_k3_surfaces that move between artin - invariant strata . in particular , fixing a jacobian elliptic_fibration x → p1 on a single supersingular_k3_surface , the family deforms as k ∞ over k ∞ is a an_elliptic_pencil over k [ [ t ] ] in such a way that the fiber x ∞ → p1 non - trivial torsor_under the base_change of the jacobian of x → p1 to k ∞ . ( it is clear from the footnote on page 552 of [ 2 ] that artin was well aware of this construction . ) 1 2 max lieblich ( 2 ) the geometric generic fibration x ∞ → p1 k ∞ has a multisection that is purely k ∞ . this relates the special_fiber and the geometric generic inseparable over p1 fiber , up to inseparable extensions . thus , if the special_fiber is unirational , so is the generic_fiber . ( 3 ) one can apply this construction at enough generic points of the moduli_space of supersingular_k3_surfaces to accountBR. then f is a finite morphism and , for f to be an_isomorphism , it is necessary and sufficient that a is normal . consequently , if we let a0 = a and ai + 1 be the blowing - up of ai at the closed point , the sequence a0 = a , a1 , . . . terminates at some an and this an is equal to a . we can write for some ti ∈ ox , yi . since { xi } are disjoint , we have { xi } = specox , yi / ( ti ) h 0 ( x , ox ( d ) / ox ) = lm 1 1 ti oxBR! n xs = n + 1 − r n ! 2n − r − s xs = n + 1 − r r + s n − r n ! − 1 2n r n ! _______ we do_not find any further_simplifications of the last_expression but numerical data leads_us_to make the following conjecture 1 : ssi ( 2n + 1 ) ∼ λ n − 1 / 2 for some positive_constant λ when n tends_to infinity ( which is equivalent to saying_that the double sum in ssi ( 2n + 1 ) above is approximately λ 4n ) . conjecture 2 : ssi ( 2n + 1 ) / ssi ( 1 ) = o ( √ n ) . note_that since ssi ( j ) = ssi ( 1 ) ( as j = d 1 ) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ 2n andp2n ssi ( 2n + 1BR. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 4 . reference . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 1 . introduction the conventional computers are not usable in dark as the user cannot see the keyboard to operate properly . but there are many_situations where the user may like to work on his computer under low light conditions , such as , during nights , while traveling in flights / trains having low lights , working in the garden during evening etc . so it is necessary to provide some light to the laptop to operate the keyboard under low light situations . inventions_on keyboard illumination , by_umakant_mishra_http_: /_/_www . trizsite . tk there are several methods of providing
