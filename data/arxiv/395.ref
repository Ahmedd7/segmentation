fit model of shape a , as described_above , as solid_lines . the fit is generally very_good , apart_from little differences in the shape of the blue peak , which occurs especially in the cmd at r around 18 . 5 -

level diagrams can affect higgs_production_cross_sections due_to interference_effects_between sm and 4dchm diagrams , so that the low_energy approach cannot_be sufficiently_accurate in the processes that concern our analysis . furthermore , as already intimated , extra modifications to the various observables can also arise because of the presence of nondecoupled extra_gauge_bosons that give extra modifications ( via mixing ) to the couplings involved in the hs and vbf_processes . these coupling alterations can affect both the higgs - vector - vector and vector - fermion - fermion_couplings . lastly , loop - induced couplings , such as h γ z , h γ γ and / or hgg , could also be affected_by the presence of new fermions and , for the former , bosons running in the corresponding loop_diagrams . all these effects can therefore modify the signal_strengths in a way that may be detectable with the experimental accuracies expected at future electron - positron_colliders . motivated_by this additional reason , weBRf ( x1 ) , . . . , f ( xk ) ) . furthermore , for any function f : x1 × ·_·_· × xk → y and subsets x UNK i ⊆ xi , i = 1 , . . . , k , we define f ( x UNK 1 , . . . , x UNK k ) : = f ( x UNK 1 × ·_·_· × x UNK k ) . for any function f : x → y and any graph g with vertex set v ( g ) ⊆ x we denote by f ( g ) the graph obtained from g by replacing each vertex v by f ( v ) ( so the vertex set of f ( g ) is f ( v ( g ) )BRvelocity , h is the equivalent boundary_layer_thickness ( i . e . h = UNK hf UNK xt / 2 in cases lc1 , lc2 and h = UNK hf UNK xt in case to1 , cf . figure_1b , c ) , and ν is the kinematic_viscosity . similarly , the friction reynolds_number is defined as re τ = u τ UNK hf UNK xt / ν , where the friction velocity u τ is computed by extrapolation of the total shear_stress to the fully - developed value of the wall - normal location of the average fluid - bed interface UNK hb UNK x . further physical_parameters are the ratio of particle to fluid density , ρ p / ρ f , the galileo number ga = ugd / ν ( where ug = ( ( ρ p / ρ f − 1 ) gd ) 1 / 2 and d the particle diameter ) , the shields number θ = u2 g and the length_scale ratio
