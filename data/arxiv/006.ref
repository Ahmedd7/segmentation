( 2013 ) have revisited the rlof models of han et_al . ( 2003 ) with more_sophisticated_treatment of angular_momentum_loss . their revised models show mass – orbital_period relations that increase substantially as a function of composition , with solar_metallicity models reaching periods up to 1100 d . they also note_that by allowing the transfer of material extending_beyond the classic roche_lobe ( atmospheric rlof ) they can reach periods as long as ∼ 1600 d . in this_paperBR- algebra of a θ and i µ is an ideal_generated_by the “ scaled unit ” relations x1x3 = x3x4 = 1 µ e , where µ > 0 is a constant . thus the algebra a θ is a coordinate_ring of elliptic_curve e ( c ) , such that isomorphic elliptic_curves correspond_to the stably_isomorphic ( morita_equivalent ) noncommutative_tori ; this fact explains the modular_transformation law in ( 4 ) . in particular , θ ∼ = s α , 1 , − 1 ( c ) / i µ , where a0 5 if e ( c ) has complex_multiplication by an order rf = z + f ok in a quadratic field k = q ( √ − d ) , then a θ has real multiplication by an order rf = z + fok in the quadratic field k = q ( √ d ) , where f is the smallest_integer_satisfying equation ( 2 ) , see [ nikolaev 2014BRchannel number 400 ) correspond_to the yield of la and sr for the case of laalo3 and srtio3 , respectively . from the angular scans the angle difference_between the layer and substrate can_be determined as shown in fig . 2 . from the detailed channelling data , can_be revealed and therefore the strain_tensor can_be determined via eq . 2 . 6 _ 101 _ 011 _ 010hkl  dividing the la range of the interest of the film into three parts , the angular scans , show depth dependent behaviour . in figure 3 the angular scan data of direction is shown in lsco film on laalo3_substrate . from the observed differences in the positions of the dip of theBR, ngc 4485 / 4490 nicely follows the correlation_between sfr and ulx number ( mapelli_et_al . 2010 , see also grimm et_al . 2003 ; ranalli_et_al . 2003 ; mineo_et_al . − 3 ulxs , 2012 ) : for an sfr of ≈ 5 . 5 m_⊙_yr − 1 , we expect 6 + 6 fairly_consistent with the observed number of eight or nine ( with cxou_j123030 . 3 + 413853 ) ulxs . cxou_j123030 . 3 + 413853 is close to the tail that connects ngc_4490 with the smaller companion ngc 4485 , but is neither in a star - forming_region nor close to a young_star cluster ( as it appears from the sloan_digital_sky_survey data_release 7 data base ; abazajian_et_al . 2009 ) . a large_fraction of hmxbs and ulxs were found to be offset with_respect_to the closest star_forming_region and / or young_star cluster ( e . g . zezas et_al . 2002 ; kaaret_et_al . 2004 ; berghea 2009 ; poutanen_et_al . 2013 ) . the most_likely_explanation is that a number of x - ray_binaries were ejected from the parent_star cluster as a consequence of either supernova kick or dynamical interaction ( e . g . gualandris et_al . 2005 ; fragos_et_al . 2009 ; mapelli_et_al . 2011a ; repetto , davies &_sigurdssonBR; phys . rev . e 81 , 011134 ( 2010 ) .
