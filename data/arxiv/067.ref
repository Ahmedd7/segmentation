that bof is a reasonable model for local regions , but not for the entire image . we also did experiments for the “ l = 2 , pyramid ” setting . we can see that the sensing 2 kernel achieves almost the same performance as the state - of - the - art sp and mrf . the improvement is not as significant as in the “ l = 2 singlelevel ” case . this could_be because it involves the l = 0 level kernel values , which does_not fit the bof model well . 6 . conclusion in this_paper , we proposed a novel kernel design principle to incorporate partial model information . on two_distinct types of data , we showed_that with minimal modeling assumptions , the sensing - aware kernel improves_upon other standard kernels and handcrafted kernels for specific domains . we also observed that the sensing - aware kernel can match the performance of the state - of - the - art_approaches .

( 2012 ) . the reminder of the paper is structured as follows . section 2 introduces definition and basic_properties of the two - exponent law and the compared alternative models . statistical_tests used to assess goodness of fit to data and tests used for model selection are presented as_well . section 3 describes our data on impact_factors , while section 4 presents and discusses empirical_findings . finally , section 5 concludes . 1waltman & van_eck ( 2009 ) have criticized the approach of egghe ( 2009 ) from anBR2 ∗ action with general mass m on s4 . here we simply illustrate_how this works with the bosonic action . with given boundary fields qa , the bulk fields ϕ i with i = 1 , 2 , 3 satisfy the modified dirichlet_boundary_conditions . so the tower of higher fourier_modes for these fields on i become heavy with mass gap 1 and r1 decouple in the small r1 limit . more_precisely , one can write y m µ i y m ( µ i ϕ i = g2 1 ( q ) − g2 b [ qa , ¯ qb ] y + ·_·_· , ( 2 . 44 ) with 0 ≤ y ≤ 2 π r1 , where ·_·_· denotes ‘ higherBR] , although in a completely_different context . to extend at the nonperturbative level the action of fierz and pauli , adding to the einstein - hilbert_action a non - derivative self - coupling for the metric g , it is required the introduction of an_additional metric f that may be a fixed external_field , or a dynamical one . when f is non - dynamical we are in the framework of aether - like theories where diff . invariance can_be restored by the introduction of a suitable set of stuckelberg_fields ; on the other_hand , if it is dynamical , we enter in the context of bigravity theories . unfortunately , for a generic potential the theory has a ghost propagating degree of freedom ( d . o . f . ) [ 3 ] , the so - called boulware - deser_ghost , associated_with the ostrogradski ghost in more_general_setup . notably , the fierz - pauli theory was constructed so that it has five healthy propagating_degrees of freedom , while the sixth mode is removed due_to the specific_choice ofBR) = 1 ; 3 . e = 2k1 + 1 + 1 , s = 2k1 + 1 and l = 2k1 + 1 , where k1 is odd and gcd ( k1 , m ) = 1 ; 4 . e = 2k1 + 1 + 1 , s = 2k1 and l = 2k1 − 1 , where k1 is even and gcd ( k1 , m ) = 1 ; 5 . e = 2k1 + 1 − 1 , s = 2k1 and l = 2k1 + 1 , where k1 is odd and gcd ( k1 ( k1 + 1 ) , m ) = 1 ; 6 . e = 2k1 + 1 − 1 , s = 2k1 − 1 and l = 2k1 − 1 , where k1 is even and gcd ( k1 ( k1 + 1 ) , m ) = 1 . proof : the above six cases can_be proved in the same_way , so we only show the assertion for the case ( 1 ) holds as follows . 6 note_that theBR, ¯ x − ztk k i k ) − g ( ¯ x ) k · k ¯ x − ztk k k k i = hg ( ztk ≤ kg ( ztk ≤ lk ¯ x − ztk k k2 , and we also have by ( 14 ) - ( 16 ) and hg ( ztk k ) , ¯ x − ztk k i = o ( k ¯ x − ztk k k2 ) , hxk − ztk k , ∇ g ( ztk k ) t ( xk − ztk k ) i = o ( k ¯ x − ztk k k2 ) , 10 ( 14 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) also by ( 13 ) , we_know 0 = if we suppose 1 2h ¯ x − ztk k , ∇ g ( ztk k ) t ( ¯ x − ztk k ) i + ( k ¯ x − ztk k k2 ) .
