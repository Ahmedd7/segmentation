2 ) ρ ( x , y ) = ρ ( y , x ) y ( symmetric ) ; 3 ) ρ ( x , y ) ≤ ρ ( x , z ) + ρ ( z , y ) ( the triangle_inequality ) . the pair ( x , ρ ) is called a metric_space . we are_interested in the following class of metric_spaces ( x , ρ ) . every point x has the infinite number of coordinates x = ( α 1 , . . . , α n , . . . ) . each coordinate yields the finite number of values , α ∈ am = { 0 , . . . , m − 1 } , ( 1 ) ( 2 ) where m > 1 is a natural number , the base of the alphabet am . the metric ρ should_be so called ultrametric , i . e . , satisfy the strong triangle_inequality : ρ ( x , y ) ≤ max [ ρ ( x , z ) , ρ ( z , y ) ] , x , yBR( mzl ) was used to compute land_é g - factors for feh_lines . we determine the distribution of magnetic_fields by magnetic spectral_synthesis performed with the synmast code . we test two different magnetic geometries to probe the influence of field orientation effects . results . our analysis confirms that feh_lines are excellent indicators of surface magnetic_fields in low - mass stars of type m , particularly in comparison to profiles of na i lines that are heavily_affected_by water lines and suffer problems with continuum normalization . the field distributions in all four stars are characterized_by three_distinct groups of field components , the data are neither consistent_with a smooth distribution of different field_strengths , nor with one average field_strength covering the full star . we find evidence of a subtle_difference in the field distribution of gj 285 compared to the other three targets . gj 285 also has the highest average field of 3 . 5 kg and the strongest maximum field component of 7 – 7 . 5 kg . the maximum local field_strengths in our sample seem to be correlated with rotation_rate . while the average field_strength is saturated , the maximum local field_strengths in our sample show no_evidence for saturationBRpossibility of their free oscillations which may accompany the generic collision process . while two point particles under collision just change their momenta , but remain in the same intrinsic state , the branes will get excited and will not remain in the initial_state even asymptotically . physically , the most_interesting case is interaction of domain_walls with particles in four_dimensions . this was_investigated long_ago in connection with topological_defects in cosmology . the solution of linearized_einstein_equations for gravitational_field of thin planar domain_wall was_found by vilenkin [ 1 , 2 ] . gravity of domain_walls is repulsive , so a particle impinging_on the wall may be reflected at some finite distance , transferring the momentum to the wall . this gives_rise_to the friction_force acting_upon the wall moving in cosmic plasma [ 3 ] . here we will be interested in more_subtle effect of excitation of the wall during the collision , especially in the situation when the particle energy is enough to reach the wall and to pierce it . fortunately , such piercing collision may be treated_analytically with the linearized_gravity theory . in fact , one important_feature associated_with codimension of embedding of an extended object into the bulk is the degree of singularity of the linearized gravitational_field at its location . gravitational_field diverges as a negative power of the distance for codimension_greater_than two , it diverges_logarithmically for codimension two , but it_remains finite in the case of the domain_wallBRa , b , c : d ) t ( b , c : d ) t ( a , b , c : d ) . which can_be again simplified by removing useless gates to t ( : d ) t ( a , d : c ) t ( b , d : c ) t ( : d ) t ( a , b , c : d ) t ( a , b : d ) t ( a , b , d : c ) t ( a , d : c ) t ( a , b ,BRcost_minimization , the overall scale_factor β is irrelevant and the degree of regularization depends_only on the ratio ξ ≡ α / β . for networks where the number of training patterns nt far_exceeds the number of weights nw , bishop ( 1995 ) derives the following updating_rules for α and β , α τ + 1 = β τ + 1 = nww τ 2 nt χ 2 ( w τ ) , ( 45 ) ( 46 ) where χ 2 ( w ) ( see eq . 14 ) is the sum of squares of residuals for the training_data . thus , we update ξ as ξ τ + 1 = nwBRphysical_review_letters ( 2012 ) . 107 , 180601 ( 2011 ) .
