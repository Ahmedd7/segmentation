well we are again dealing_with a system with very_large numbers of agents and we have analogues of position and momentum . the total debt / credit position of an agent is analogous to its mass , and the rate of change of its debt / credit position is analogous to its momentum . thus if two billion people in the world are enmeshed in debt / credit relations then the whole system can_be thought of as a phase_space of 2 billion dimensions . it is impossible to visualise a space with high numbers of dimensions , so there are graphical techniques that people use to reason_about them . one trickBRp → p → 0 0 → p ∨ → d ∨ π → zs → 0 . let ( a . 6 . 2 ) be the p ∨ - torsor associated to above extension . we call td the stack of multiplicative splitting of d . to justify its namely , let_us_give a description of td . by definition the dual of d is td = π − 1 ( 1 ) d ∨ = hom ( d , bgm ) . an element s ∈ d ∨ belongs_to td : = ( d ∨ ) 1 if and only if the composition bgm i → dBR, s . gunther , b . wang , j . h . dil , m . - l . bocquet , j . osterwalder , j . wintterlin , and t . greber , phys . rev . b 79 , 045407 ( 2009 ) . 14 d . pacil ` e , p . leicht , m . papagno , p . m . sheverdyaeva , p . moras , c . carbone , k . krausert , l . zielke , m . fonin , y . s . dedkov , f . mittendorfer , j . doppler , a . garhofer , and j . redinger , phys . rev . b 87 , 035420 ( 2012 ) . 15 c . enderlein , y . s . kim , a . bostwick , e . rotenberg , and k . horn , new j . physBRUNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK
