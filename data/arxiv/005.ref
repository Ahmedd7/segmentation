on gravitation . abstract we consider a possibility that the formally infinite vacuum_energy of the quantized matter_fields could_be stored into planck - size quantum black_holes , which act as the fundamental constituents of space and time . using the recently_proposed thermodynamical equation of state obeyed by the cosmological_constant we indicate , how this idea might_explain the smallness of the cosmological_constant , if the vacuum_energy is the source of the cosmological_constant . pacs : 04 . 60 . nc , 04 . 60 . bc , 98 . 80 . qc . keywords_: vacuum_energy , black_holes one of the deepest mysteries of physics is the vacuum_energy of the matter_fields : quantum_mechanics predicts that every matter field has a unique vacuum_state , where the energy_density is infinite . usually , one just ignores the vacuum_energy and considers the excited_states of the matter_fields only . however , the vacuum_state with its infinite energy_density is certainly present , and it even yields observable effects . one of them is the casimir_effect , where the vacuum_energy of the electromagnetic_field produces a tiny attractive_force_between metal_plates brought very_close to each_other , and whose existence has_been_proved experimentally . [ 1 ] it is reasonable to think that even_though the vacuum_energy is very_large , it is not infinite , butBR1997 ) . [ 9 ] e . o . budrene and h . c . berg , nature , 376 ( 6535 ) , 49 ( 2000 ) .

dimensional surfaces [ 22 ] . as a result of distortion , the space - time curvature can become very_high at some regions of black_hole_horizon [ 10 ] . in this_paper , we illustrate that distorted black_holes have some unique and universal properties . let_us_now_discuss construction of static and axisymmetric distorted_black_hole solutions . in four_dimensions , the general static , axisymmetric solution of the vacuum_einstein_equations can_be written in the form of weyl solution which is defined by one of its metric function solving the laplace_equation in an auxiliary three - dimensional flat_space . the other remaining metric function is derived by a line integral defined by the first one . having written one of the einstein_equations as the laplace_equation in a three - dimensional flat_space is a great_advantage . one can consider its solution as a newtonian_potential of some axisymmetric source . in addition , because the laplace_equation is linear , one can use the superposition_principle . as a result , distorted_black_hole solutions can_be constructed by adding_extra harmonic_functions to the original one , which represents the black_hole source . these functions represent the distortion fields . – 2 – in higher -

( 2012 ) ) , in which we mainly examined the descattering of the ppa curve . in this_paper , we have noted that ism scattering can damage and distort some of the observed stokes_phase_portraits ; for some pulsars , without recovering the data from ism scattering effect 2 would mislead our analysis ( see section 3 ) . we have recovered pulse intensity and ppa curve shape in previous_work ( rusul et_al .
