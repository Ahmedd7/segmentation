( b ) a typical high - level event flow ; ( c ) the correlation of memory trace and high - level events . those memory traces mainly reflect low - level ( machinelevel ) information which is obscure for most people . from the perspective of system level , a computer system generates various events , such as context switch , function call , syscall and i / o request . figure 1 ( b ) illustrates a typical event flow . to capture high - level event flow , one may instrument source_code or binary at points of these events manually or automatically . in contrast with memory trace , those events are at higher_levels and contain more semantic_information which people can understand more_easily . however , only given highlevel events , it is usually insufficient to analyze system ’_s performance and behaviors in depth . based_on the above observations , we can conclude_that there is a semanticBRin fig . 3c . thus , hh and v v correlations rotate into predominantly rr and ll correlations , while rl and lr turn mostly into hv and v h , which explains the observations of fig . 2 . for a nanowire waveguide of 6 µ m length a difference of effective_refractive_index of order 0 . 1 would_be enough to explain the magnitude of the observed rotation . apart_from birefringence in the waveguide , the polarization state of the emitted_photons could also have_been influenced 6 by γ 7 and γ 9 hole mixing in the wurtzite quantum_dot . discussion in summary , we used a wurtzite nanowire quantum_dot to generate single pairs of polarization - entangled_photons with a fidelity as high as 0 . 859 ±BRfig . 1 . setup for thz scattering from granular_matter . a beam from a quantum cascade laser ( qcl ) operating at 3 . 4 thz is chopped in a lock - in configuration to suppress thermal background radiation . the incoming_beam is scattered from a quasi - two dimensional granular sample at variable angle θ . a golay - cell is used as a detector . the development of terahartz quantum_cascade_lasers ( qcls ) [ 13 , 14 ] make experiments feasible that are in close_analogy to static light_scattering ( sls ) setups which apply visible_light . in sls , lasers provide collimated , monochromatic , high intensity radiation . common solvents like water , organic_liquids and air are transparent , and background light is easily shielded by lightproof containers . using thz_radiation imposes several constraints not present in experiments with visible_light : many media including ambient_air are highly absorbing over large regions of the thz spectrum , and strong background radiation from thermal_emission at_room_temperature has to be faced [ 5 ] . to overcome these constraints we use ( 1 ) a transmission window of air at 3 . 4 thz , ( 2 ) thin , effectively two - dimensional samples and ( 3 ) lock - in detection of the signal . consequently , we obtained a versatile bench - top experimentBRattributes of the camera itself . 4 context information among_others , contextual_information can_be a dynamic grid map where static objects are detected . in [ 7 ] an approach to incorporate this information in the preprocessing_step of the sensors is proposed , but the same approach could also be used to improve the tracking directly , using the information map as interface to detection or birth probability . in case of static setups , e . g . intelligent infrastructure , most of the contextual_information like traffic lanes , sidewalks and much_more are static as_well . in this case , it is a very practical approach to store context information in a static map . one example for such an intelligent infrastructure provides the ko - per project , which is part of research_initiative ko - fas [ 1 ] , where a major intersection was equipped_with a network of laser range finders and mono cameras [ 3 ] ( see fig . 5 ) . if a bird figure 5 : intersection of the ko - fas project [ 3 ] . eye image or a digital map of this intersection is available , an information map can_be used to incorporate context information . at this intersection , one problem of the tracking using laser range finders is to initialize new tracks with a correct orientation_angle , because the obtained box - measurements using a box - fit have very_uncertain information_about the orientation . us5 ( a ) three laser range finders mounted at the front of a vehicle . 100BRthe four - gluon_condensate is neglected in the evaluation of this_work . moreover , in order to obtain a relatively reliable result through the leading_order calculation , one_needs to depress the higher_order_qcd_corrections and hence to express the mc 1 + in terms of eq . ( 20 ) , which is found to be less_sensitive to the radiative_corrections than to the individual moments [ 24 ] . 3 numerical_analysis in performing the numerical_evaluation , the values of the input_parameters , the condensates , and the quark_masses are adopted as follows [ 24 , 26 , 28 , 29 ] : md = 6 . 4 mev , mu = 2 . 3 mev , mc ( mc ) = ( 1 . 23 ± 0 . 05 ) gev , mb ( mb ) = ( 4 . 24 ± 0 . 06 ) gev , h_¯_qqi = − ( 0 . 23 ± 0 . 03 ) 3 gev3 , h ¯_qgs_σ_· gqi = m2 0 = 0 . 8 gev2 . m2 sBRmechanics are adjusted to minimize the horizontal and angular_velocities of the moving coil during up and down motion , see [ 14 ] . ( 2 ) the axis of the superconductor is aligned to be vertical by measuring the mutual_inductance_between the superconductor and a homemade coil_assembly mounted_on a leveling platform [ 13 ] . the angle of the field can_be adjusted by tilting the dewar containing the superconducting_coil . ( 3 ) the electrical center of the moving coil is made coincident_with the center of the magnetic_field generated_by the superconductor . the measurement for this alignment step is again a mutual_inductance measurement . this time an alignment instrument with three individual coils is used . the electrical center of the coil can_be moved by translating the watt_balance wheel . after this step , the field is turned_on . ( 4 ) the tilt of the moving coil is changed such that the coil does_not experience any horizontal forces when current is applied to the coil , indicating that the magnetic axes of both the superconducting_coilBRof the total epitope density et . in other_words , all adhered cells will have the same density of free epitopes and thus of all other complexes , irrespective of their total epitope density et . when α = 0 and η = 0 , our conservation_equation for mobile epitopes ( eq . 6 ) yields the following expression for δ : δ = et − ( e + e1 + 2e2 ) b10 + 2b20 + ein + e1in + 2e2in − ( e + e1 + 2e2 ) ( 17 ) UNK ∞ UNK ∞ et min fig . 2 : distribution of cd2 epitope count on jurkat t cells like those used in our experiments , as determined_by flow_cytometry . we will primarily model the distribution of target cell epitope densities by the three parameter weibull_distribution , which has density UNK x − γ UNK k − 1 λ __ k λ 0 f ( x ; γ , k , λ ) = e − ( x − γ λ ) k if x > γ if x ≤ γ .
