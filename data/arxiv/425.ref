su ( 2 ) and so ( 3 ) , and a conjecture is made [ 1 , pp . 2493 - 2494 ] that such asymptotics should hold for all α - stable processes , 0 < α < 2 , on an_arbitrary compact_lie_group . the purpose of this note is to point_out that this is indeed the case and that such results hold for a wide_class of subordinations of the laplacian on_compact_manifolds . in fact , as we_shall see , such asymptotics follow from weyl ’_s law ( 3 ) . we first record some definitions and set some_notations . let m be a compact_riemannian_manifold of dimension n and denote its riemannian measure by µ . we denote the laplace - beltrami_operator on m by − ∆ and denote its eigenvalues by 0 = λ 0 < λ 1 ≤ λ 2 ≤ ·_·_· →_∞ . as is well_known , − ∆ generates a heat_semigroup { pt } on l2 µ ( m , r ) which possesses a heat_kernel denoted here by p ( t , x , y ) . thus ptf ( x ) = e − t ∆ f ( x ) = zm p ( t , x , y ) f ( y ) dy , µ ( m , rBR( sn ) ] − 1 2 w , opt + 1 2 w ≤ 2e [ w ( sn ) ] , 3 4 opt ≤ e [ w ( sn ) ] as desired , since opt ≤ w . the following lemma is the key_insight of proving the main lemma , and is the randomized balancing of the two greedy_algorithms mentioned in the introduction . the expectation bound holds whether x ∗ i is true or false . lemma 3 . 4 e [ w ( opti − 1 ) − w ( opti ) ] ≤ max UNK 0 , 2tifi ti + fi UNK . 4 proof : assume for the moment that x ∗ i is set false ; the proof is analogous if x ∗ i is true . we claim that if xi is set true while x ∗ i is false , then w ( opti − 1 ) − w ( opti ) ≤ 2fi . if fi ≤ 0 , then we set xi true and the lemma statement_holds given the claim . if ti ≤ 0 , we set xi false ; then the assignment opti is the same as opti − 1 so that w ( opti ) − w ( opti − 1 ) = 0 and the lemma statement again holds . now assume both fi > 0 and ti > 0 . we set xi false with probability fi / ( ti + fi ) , so that again w ( opti ) − w ( opti − 1 ) = 0 . we setBR. therefore , we have shown that when ∆ / 4 < γ ( u , v ) ≤ 2 ∆ , ( u , v ) is included in the compact network . our next lemma shows that the procedure create - all - pseudoarcs will correctly construct ∆ - small pseudoarcs . a description of the algorithm ’_s implementation is in appendix b . lemma 4 . 2 . a push on any ∆ - small ( or ∆ - abundant ) pseudoarc created by the procedure create - all - pseudoarcs always corresponds_to a valid push in gf . proof . we will show that a push on any pseudoarc ( u , w ) will have a corresponding sequence of valid saturating and / or nonsaturaitng pushes in gf . while some pushes along internal arcs within a pseudoarc ( u , w ) may be inadmissible , we can use lemma 4 . 14 to show that pushes along such arcs will not affect the correctness of theBRis basically the observed value of about θ 13 = 9 ◦ , and the fact that this lepton_mixing parameter is numerically connected to quark parameters seems to support this argument , but is of course not a proof1 . nevertheless , relating the charged_lepton diagonalization to the ckm_matrix can_be arranged in grand_unified models , especially based_on su ( 5 ) , for which m ℓ = mt d is a typical outcome . such a relation has to be_viewed_as an approximation due_to the distinct mass spectra of leptons and quarks , and is modified by higher_order corrections or clebsch - gordon coefficients . nevertheless , models predicting uckm ≃ u ℓ have_been_constructed , which in addition have ( u ν ) 13 = 0 [ 9 – 13 ] . hence , the above strategy to generate ue3 = λ / √ 2 , where λ ≃ sin_θ c ≃ 0 . 23 , is based_on actual model building foundations . we will use for the sake of simplicity and definiteness uckm = u ℓ in what_follows . while the relation 9 ◦ = 0 + 9 ◦ has its virtues and attraction , one should not ignore the possibility that 9 ◦ = 18 ◦ − 9 ◦ . this means that initially u ν contains a too_large value of its 13 - element , which is reduced to its observed value by a sizable charged_lepton correction , a ckm - like one in our case . since the remaining lepton_mixing_angles are necessarily non - zero both in u and inBRUNK UNK 2n k UNK is studied . in particular , it is proved that u ( mp ) ≡ u ( m ) modulo p3 for all primes p > 5 . following the approach of theorem 1 . 2 , we obtain that , more_generally , u ( mpr ) ≡ u ( mpr − 1 ) ( mod p3r ) for all primes p > 5 . let a , b be nonnegative_integers . it is shown in [ 8 ] that the more_general sequences u ε a , b ( n ) = n ( − 1 ) ε k UNK n xk = 0 k UNK a UNK 2n k UNK b satisfy , for primes p > 5 , the congruence a , b ( p ) ≡ u ε u ε a , b ( 1 ) ( mod p3 ) 12 robert osburn , brundaban sahu and armin_straub unless ( ε , a , b ) = ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) or ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) . again , we can generalize this congruence by using the approach of theorem 1 . 2 to show that , for primes p > 5 , u ε a , b ( mpr ) ≡ ua , b ( mpr − 1 ) ( mod p3r ) provided that a + b > 2 . 4 . concluding_remarks there are severalBR[ 32 ] fichtner kh , fichtner l , freudenberg w and ohya m ( 2008 ) on a quantum model of the recognition process . qp - pq : quantum prob . white_noise analysis 21 : 64 - 84 [ 33 ] khrennikov a ( 2003 ) quantum - like formalism for cognitive measurements . biosystems 70 : 211 - 233 [ 34 ] khrennikov a ( 2004 ) on quantum - like probabilistic structure of mental information . open systems and information dynamics 11 ( 3 ) : 267 - 275 [ 35 ] khrennikov a ( 2006 ) quantum - like brain : interference of minds . biosystems 84 : 225 – 241 [ 36 ] khrennikov a ( 2008BR2 ] , so that l = UNK − s0 s 0 + h ( c , c ) s0 s 0 UNK d + UNK UNK λ UNK c − r s0 UNK + w ( c ) UNK s 3 0 UNK f .
