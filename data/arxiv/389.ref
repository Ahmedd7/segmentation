v3 [ 200 , 500 ] kpc km s − 1 . fig . 4 presents these three groups in a different way . the symbols have the same meaning as those of fig . 3 . the small black_dots_represent the non - mg stars in the whole sample . the top_panel provides their distribution in [ fe / h ] and w . most stars in v3 are metal_poor ; [ fe / h ] < - 0 . 5 dex . the w velocity distributions in v1 and v3 show larger dispersions than v2 . the middle_panel presents the distribution in [ u , v ] . v1 and v3 show very_broad dispersions in u while v2 has a small dispersion perhaps because the stars in v2 have_been perturbed by the galaxy ’_s bar . the bottom of fig . 4 plots the [ fe / h ] and vertical distance of these mgs . the distance of most stars in our sample is larger_than 200_pc . however , stars in v2 are relatively_nearby . all these mgs extend to about 1 . 5 kpc . fig . 5 presents the eccentricity distribution of three candidate streams . galactic orbits were_calculated with the milky_way potential model of allen & santillan ( 1991 ) . the model is time - independent , axisymmetric , fully analytic , and consists of a spherical central_bulge , a disk , a massive spherical_halo , and has a total mass of 9 ×_1011 solar_masses . output parameters are : the minimum and maximum distances from the galactic_center ; rmin and – 7BRci become thus labels of the vertices of the discrete path . in example 3 . 5 we give an example of an embedded boundary . let_us_define the notions of the position boundary f and the word associated_with a point in a frieze . definition 3 . 3 let λ ′ be the boundary defined above . we call position boundary f a boundary associated_with λ ′ , embedded in the discrete plane . in other_words , f = y λ ′ x . as ¯ ω ∗ bounds the modelled quiver ¯ f on the left and on the right , the part of the frieze υ containing ¯ f is bordered on the left by λ ′ and on the right by t λ ′ . considered in the euclidean_plane , ¯ f is contained in the part of the frieze υ bordered by the position boundary f = y λ ′ x on one side and tf = x t λ ′ y on the other_side , where tf is the transpose of f . note_that there is a correspondence induced by the transposition between the points of the boundaries f and tf . from now on , ¯ f and υ stand for the modelled quiver and the frieze υ considered in the euclidean_plane , that is after_replacing north - east and south - east arrows by horizontal and vertical_segments respectively . consider a point ( u , v ) in ¯ f and its horizontal and vertical projections on the boundaries f and tf . considering the following three situations suffices to define the word associated_with the point (BR∂ tn ↑ + ∇ ( n ↑ v ↑ ) = ∂ tn ↓ + ∇ ( n ↓ v ↓ ) = γ ¯ h γ ¯ h ( bysx − bxsy ) , ( bxsy − bysx ) , ( 8 ) ( 9 ) where we have applied sx and sy for mixed combinations of ψ ↑ and ψ ↓ . their explicit_form is presented and discussed_below . usually the continuity_equation shows conservation of the particle number . if we consider the spin - up electrons and the spin - down electrons separately , we find that particle numbers change due_to interaction . the total_number of electrons n = n ↑ + n ↓ conserves only . 2m ( ψ ∗ usual form js = 1 d = bp − qe particle current appears in the continuity_equation in s d ψ s + c . c . ) , where s = ↑ or ↓ , and m a . we have introduced the velocity fields vs via the particle currents js ≡ nsvs , with the following explicit_form of the velocities vs = ¯ h mc a . here weBRboth estimators are being shrinked towards a scaled identity_matrix . 0 b . radar_detection using normalized matched_filter we address the problem of detecting a known complex signalvector ( target response ) p in receiveddata z = γ p + c , where c represents the unobserved complex noise ( clutter ) r . v . and γ ∈ c is a signal parameter modeled as an unknown deterministic parameter or as a random_variable depending_on the application at_hand . both the signal vector , the noise and the received data are p - variate . in radar applications , for example , γ is a complex unknown parameter accounting_for submitted to ieee_transactions_on_signal_processing 7 2 d e c n a t s i d 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 0 2 d e c n a t s i d 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 0 30 25 20 15 10 2 d e c n a t s i d 5 0 tyl regtyl cwh 0 . 2 0 . 4 α 0 . 6 0 . 8 ( a ) ρ = 0 . 05 tyl regtyl cwh 0 . 2 0 . 4 α 0 . 6 0 . 8 ( b ) ρ = 0 . 5 tyl regtyl cwh 1 1 0 . 2 0 . 4 α 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 ( c ) ρ = 0 . 8 3 . 5 3 2 . 5 2 1 . 5 1 0 . 5 2 d e c n a t s i d 0 0 5 . 5 5 4 . 5 4 3 . 5 3 2 . 5 2 d e c n a t s i dBR- gravity corresponds , roughly , to having ( 3 . 64 ) smaller_than_unity . firstly , we focus_on the case x UNK 1 , and assume_that we are in the fast - roll ( adiabatic ) regime . since in this case we can use eq .
