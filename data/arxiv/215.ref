head – we write hn ( a ) – is the leftmost part of a that consists of only modalities which are at_least n . the remaining_part of a is called the n - remainder and is denoted_by rn ( a ) . more_formally : hn ( ⊤ ) = ⊤ ; and hn ( ma ) = mhn ( a ) in case m ≥ n and ⊤ otherwise . likewise : rn ( ⊤ ) = ⊤ and rn ( ma ) = rn ( a ) in case m ≥ n and ma otherwise . the following lemmaBRtheoretic value and give a strategy to draw against best play for white and black sides . our_approach requires surprisingly small computing power . we give a human_readable proof . the way the result is obtained is generic and could_be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games . 1 introduction solving popular games like othello , checkers or chess tantamount to the grail search in the field of computer_games . the resolution of checkers [ sbb + 07 ] put a mark in the field in the sense that the space search of this game is enormous ( 5 ×_1020 ) and the difficulty to make correct move decisions fairly high . the game of chess have always been_recognized as the ultimate challenge in artificial_intelligence . since the early_days of computer_science chess and computers have interacted together [ pro12 ] . nowadays computers have superhuman strength and the game is partially solved : endgame databases up to few piecesBRhole . the observers_located after the vainshtein scale and defining the time in agreement_with the function t0 ( r , t ) , will relate the rates of emission and absorption in the usual_way as in gr [ 11 ] . on the other_hand , if the observers define the time - coordinate in agreement_with t , then this relation is modified and it is equivalent to an_extra - component of radiation coming_from the extra - degrees of freedom . b . the periodicity of the poles of the propagator in order to prove that there is some extra - component of radiation for observers_located at scales_larger_than the vainshtein_radius , we have to compare the periodicity associated to the ordinary time - coordinate with the one associated to the function t0 ( r , t ) . this is connected with the analyticity_properties of the propagator . we can_easily calculate the positions of the poles of the propagator . in agreement_with the previous analysis of the analyticity of the propagator , there are poles when s (BRprocesses above will happen and newest “ hand ’_s center ” coordinates ( x , y and z ) and last “ hand ’_s center ” calculate the difference on each resulting on pixel moved parsing to fuzzy_logic , except z , that will define the real movement to be sent to robotics arm on angular form ranged ( 0 º - 180_º ) . figure 2 . result of high_pass_filter algorithm applied on all pixels figure 3 . result of analysis and image_processing figure 4 . formulas to calculate hand ’_s center point . 5 . fuzzy_logic the fuzzy is a multivalued_logic responsible to transform not exact information on acceptable output supporting stochastic outputs based_on rules , this way approximate human to machine [ 3 ] this start with the receipt of the amount of displacement and the direction of movement by the center of the hand applying the rules of fig . 5 for movement on x axis and fig . 6 for y axis , each of these rules on axis x represent the number of pixels displaced and y axis the degree of relevance . for these entrances fuzzy generate one output based_on result of each entrance transformed by respective rule see output rule on fig . 7 to x and y , verify this important output necessary to eliminate the problem of precise movements of the human hand . the fuzzy resultant is sent to robotic_arm on format : “ ( x , y , z ) ” each on theirBR, the underlying effects propagate_through to the collision outcomes . the lack of gravitational_focusing with ripg accounts_for a higher proportion of oblique_impacts that generally lead to an increase in hitand - run events . while the majority of these collision are non - erosive , they_do_not_contribute to the growth of the system . a more_subtle point is that the inclusion of interplanetesimal gravity results in collisions that would not otherwise occur in a scenario without gravitational_focusing . this results in a number of low speed and accretion enabling collisions . from these results we find that ef f > 0 . 01 indicates a region of the planetesimal_disk that is too perturbed to support planetesimal_growth and ef f < 0 . 01 may be calm enough for planetesimal_accretion . if we apply this criteria to all known kepler circumbinary_planets , and assuming that this critical_value applies to ef as_well , only kepler 47 ( ab ) c could_possibly have formed in - situ and all of the rest : kepler 34 ( ab ) b , 16 (BRin which the hamiltonian of the superintegrable model is perturbed by some charges ( not commuting with one another ) with time dependent coupling_constants . acknowledgments_this_work_was_supported by the epsrc under_grants ep / i032487 / 1 and ep / j014885 / 1 . the tdmrg data of figure 5 were_obtained by mario collura during the preparation of [ 10 ] . i thank claudio bonati , pasquale calabrese , mario collura , and fabian essler for stimulating_discussions . references [ 1 ] t . kinoshita , t . wenger , d . s . weiss , nature_440 , 900 ( 2006 ) .
