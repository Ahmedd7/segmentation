( cf . [ 6 ] 3 . 12 ) . this is proved in the following steps : ( a ) by [ 13 ] , every continuous local homomorphism between smooth local left or right loops is smooth in a neighborhood of the neutral_element . ( b ) for each flag ( o , k ) , a local ternary field can_be introduced similar to the global construction in 1 . 4 such that addition defines a local loop on k with neutral_element o . ( c ) for each line k , the restriction γ kBRpopulation of stars with uniform y = 0 . 265 cannot_be ruled_out on the basis of only the hb analysis , while a single population of stars with y = 0 . 28 , as proposed by caloi &_d_’_antona ( 2005 ) and d_’_antona & caloi ( 2008 ) , is incompatible_with the distribution of stars in our uv cmd . for m 3 a single synthetic population with ymin = 0 . 246 and distributed_according_to a uniform_probability_distribution with ∆ y = 0 . 02 is required . a total mass_loss of ∆ m = 0 . 122m ⊙ and a linear increase as a function of y , as constrained by the fit of star_counts as a function of magnitude and colors , is needed . as highlighted by gratton_et_al . ( 2010 ) , while m 13 seems to behave_as other relatively massive_clusters , m 3 appears to be peculiar and a more extended hb would_have_been expected in this case . our results would_lead_to think that m 3 and m 13 experienced a different amount of enrichment of light elements . this would_be compatible_with the scenario proposed by gratton_et_al . ( 2010 ) ( see also carretta_et_al . 2009a ) that invokes a delayed cooling flow in the case of m 3 . in particular the hb simulations and derived y distributions would_suggest that m 13 is qualitatively_similar fig . 6 uv integrated colors as a function of metallicity in carretta_et_al .
