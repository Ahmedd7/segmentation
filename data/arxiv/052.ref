cyclic cosmologies ( in the following ccc ) . at the centre of the ccc - proposal lies the idea that spacetimes ( termed aeons ) with a de_sitter - like cosmological_constant form a successive chain . two_consecutive aeons are joint in a bridging spacetime [ 31 ] by identifying the future_null_infinity of one aeon with ∗ e - mail_address_:_christian . luebbe @_gmail . com , c . luebbe @_ucl . ac . uk 1 the isotropic singularity describing the big_bang of the next aeon . one aspect that has_been highlighted in [ 30 ] is that the matching of i imposes a vanishing_weyl_tensor , while the weyl_tensor may be non - zero at the isotropic singularity . thus the setting in the future aeon appears to require specific fine_tuning . the results of [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] highlight that for a chosen matter model we need to check_whether there_exists a sufficiently_large family of solutions satisfying the fine - tuning or whether one is automatically reduced to the conformally_flat case . the existence of explicit pairs of physical spacetimes satisfying the ccc - proposal which are not conformally_flat has_been_recently_shown in [ 31 ] . 1 observe_that , despite the use of an unphysical ’ bridging metric ’ to formulate the concepts of conformal_boundary and isotropic singularity , the ccc - scenario requires two physical spacetimes that are conformally_related . a similar conformal relationship_between two physical spacetimes was_already observed by bekenstein in [ 3 ] . he_showed that a spacetime ( m , g ) with an ordinary scalar_field , an electromagnetic_field and a radiation fluid is conformally_related to a spacetime ( mBR◦ α ) ( θ , x , y ) = ( θ , x , y2 , xy ) . proof . this proposition is a special_case of a general theorem of szucs [ 20 ] . note_that in our case the normal_bundles of σ ( f ) and f ( σ ( f ) ) are trivial .

although the edges are irrelevant , we still include them in the figures below for the sake of clarity . however , it is important to remember that the vertices can_be connected in anyBRthe gln models will lead to a better_performance_than the current approximation . the eln models perform_better_than the original en models , due_to the fact that not only the regular probes , but also the control probes are skew - distributed ( [ 4 ] ) . therefore , these models could_be the second choice after the gln , when the gn model does_not work . 3 . with regard to the computation time , at the benchmarking data set the en models are working faster_than the others . they are followed_by the elnp , 33 elnn , and egm . the glnn and the enmc are the third fastest , then come the gn and the elnm , which are followed_by the glnm as the slowest one . 4 . as we will show in a subsequent paper , it is possible to develop a new model which satisfies all of the affycomp criteria , the consistency in the background correction and the parametrization errors . one of the purposes of using microarray technology is finding the genes which are expressed differentially due_to some disease or condition . therefore , it is important to investigate the effectBRas for instance , the isoscalar_monopole and the isovector_dipole giant_resonances [ 3 ] and neutron_skin_thickness [ 4 ] or on astrophysical_observations [ 5 , 6 ] . until 2010 , when a star with a mass of almost 2 m_⊙ was_confirmed [ 7 ] , most eos were expected to produce maximum stellar_masses just larger_than 1 . 44 m_⊙ and radii of the order of 10 to 12 km . some of them , as the nl3 parametrization [ 2 ] of the non - linear walecka_model ( nlwm ) were even discarded to be considered too_hard and to provide too_large solar_masses . recently a second very massive_neutron_star was detected [ 8 ] and many parametrizations and models were revisited and readjusted to account for the new observations . also , many other constraints based_on the above_mentioned nuclear properties and also on the symmetry energy , its slope , skewness , dipole_polarizabilities , heavyion collision flows , isobaric_analog_states , etc , have_been_proposed [ 9 , 10 ] . as far as relativistic models are concerned , the ω − ρ interaction [ 11 , 12 ] can_be adjusted to reproduce experimental values of the symmetry energy and its related slope , the latest being strongly_correlated with many nuclear [ 13 ] and stellar properties [ 14 ] . on the other_hand , it is well_known that the eos and the internal constitution of the neutron_stars depend_on the nature of the strong_interaction . in a compact star ,BRnumerical code includes the following numerical dissipation , η num ∼ 0 . 03c ∆ , where ∆ is the mesh_size . this means our numerical code can calculate accurately problems with the lundquist_number up to snum = lca / η num ∼ 20nca / c where n is the mesh number along the current_sheet . as explained in sec . 3 , we use the mesh number n = 8192 along the current_sheet , our calculation has sufficient_accuracy up to sl ∼ 3 ×_105 . 〉 c / r v 〈 e t a r n o i t c e n n o c e r 〉 c / r v 〈 e t a r n o i t c e n n o c e r l = 320 δ l = 80 δ l = 20 δ - 1 / 2 sl 0 . 1 0 . 01 100_1000_10000_100000_1e + 06 sl l = 320 δ l = 80 δ - 1 / 2 sl 0 . 1 0 . 01 0 . 001 1000_10000_100000_1e + 06 sl fig . 3 . — the plot of the time averaged reconnection_rate hvr / cai over the statistical_equilibrium region with_respect_to the lundquist_number sl . top : the strongly_magnetized case : σ in = 14 . bottom : the weakly_magnetized case :BRp q = 0 , which_contradicts the condition . if p 2 − 4q < 0 , from the above we see that = UNK p + pp 2 − 4q p − pp 2 − 4q UNK k = 1 .
