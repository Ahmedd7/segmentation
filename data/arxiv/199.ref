[BRpsf to convolve the galaxy models , i accounted approximately for the convolution by the pixels in the psf model itself . this worked_well for the parameters i used , but for a poorly_sampled psf this approach could result in relatively_large_errors . i used a fast approximation to the exponential function for evaluating the gaussians in the galaxy models . even so , evaluation of the exponential function was the computational_bottleneck for the likelihood evaluation . i applied priors for the non - shape parameters in order to make exploration of the likelihood surface more_efficient . the prior on the shapes was not applied during exploration , because the p , q and r are to be averaged_over the likelihood . this separation was possibly only because the shapes were not covariant with the other parameters . during fitting , i used prior_distributions matched exactly to the true distributions used in the simulation . i used the correct s_´_ersic_index for fitting inBRd ) j d 2 ) , y ( 1 , 1 , f − d ( 2 − f ) ) ( mk ( x ) ) , ( 1 + d , 1 , f − d ( 1 − f ) ) ( x ) = ____ x ∈ d · jk , k = 1 . . . r x ∈ [ 0 , d 2 ) x ∈ jk , k = 1 . . . r y ( 1 + d , 0 , 1 + d ) ( mk ( x d ) ) , y ( 1 + d , 1 , f − d ( 1 − f ) ) ( x ( 1 + d ) y d 2 ) , ( 1 , 1 , f − d ( 2 − f ) ) ( mk ( x ) ) , x ∈ d · jk , k = 1BRis the max of each_entry of the matrix . in order to show a 2 × 2 matrix converges , it_suffices_to show that each_entry of the matrix converges . we will often employ this strategy . we_conclude this section with some useful matrix identities and notation . we write hi to be the ith_column ( of 2 × 2 blocks ) of hn and h ( i ) to be the ith_column of hn with the ith_block removed . we let r ( i ) n be the resolvent of hn where the ith_row and ith_column of hn ( viewed_as an n × n matrix of 2 × 2 blocks ) have_been_removed . finally γ ( i ) UNK i n ( q ) : = 1 n j UNK = i r ( i ) jj . √ − 1tn , with tn going to zero polynomially and 6 . 2 . a priori_estimate . following the ideas of [ 4 ] we begin with an a priori_bound on γ n ( q ) − γ ( q ) for η = e + e ∈ [ 0 , c ] . this gives an_upper_bound on the number of singular_valuesBRan i - packing also forms a 2i + 1 - packing in s ( g ) . using color 1 on subdivision vertices and using the coloring c ( considering the sequence differently ) on original vertices , we obtain a ( 1 , 2s1 + 1 , . . . , 2sk + 1 ) - coloring of s ( g ) . corollary 1 . for every subcubic_graph g , s ( g ) is ( 1 , 3 , 3 , 3 ) - colorable . proof . brooks ’ theorem_asserts that every subcubic_graph except k4 is ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) - colorable . hence , by proposition 1 , every subcubic_graph g except k4 is such that s ( g ) is 3 ( 1 , 3 , 3 , 3 ) - colorable .BR2 ] m . goeppert - mayer , phys . rev . 48 , 512 ( 1935 ) .
