necessary in lot of applications to obtain the high_quality image from two source images . there are different image fusions techniques are leading now days but in this seminar we have considered laplacian_pyramid . image_fusion using laplacian_pyramid and wavelet_transform has_been simulated using matlab_software . references [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] gonzalo pajares , jesus manuel de lacruz “ a wavelet – based_image_fusion tutorial ” the journal of the pattern_recognition society , pattern_recognition 37 ( 2004 ) qiang zhang , long wang , huijuan li zhaokun ma “ similarity - based multi modality image_fusion with shiftable complex directional pyramid ” pattern_recognition_letters 32 ( 2011 ) 1544 - 1553 v . aslantas , rBRlight turns green and red , respectively . the red_line_represents the theoretical results of the steady_state . large . the traffic capacities of the pedestrian – vehicle separation signal and the ordinary ( mixed ) signal are shown in the supplemental_figure of fig . 9 ( a ) . the pedestrian – vehicle separation signal has a large traffic capacity for a wide_range of λ compared with the ordinary intersection . while the traffic capacity falls when there are pedestrians , the traffic_light does_not_significantly cut down traffic_flow . c . theoretical_analysis the traffic_light makes the traffic and the pedestrian_flows unsteady . first , we considerBRas the pauli_matrices τ and σ . in the present case , we find gk ∼ − ( 0 . 03 + 0 . 02cxcy ) τ 3 and γ k ∼ − 0 . 02 ( σ xsy + σ ysx ) + 0 . 15 ( σ xsycx + σ ysxcy ) − 0 . 63 τ 1 ( σ xsxcy + σ ysycx ) + 0 . 27 τ 3 ( σ xsycx − σ ysxcy ) . there are some remarkable_features here . first , the singlet part gk transforms as d - wave ( via τ 3 ) , but the amplitude is relatively_small . the dominant part is theBRfig . 5c , upper_right_panel ) the array is so disordered that it becomes difficult to identify the type of the original particle arrangement . indeed , rectangular formations give space to polygonal ones , such as irregular hexagons seen in the upper_left_corner of the figure ( fig . 5c ) . analyzing the dop t ( n ) scatter_plots , one can see that the particles forming triangular_grid keep the optimal distance at the values corresponding to the unperturbed system even under significant displacement ∆ d . this regarding random particle_displacements robustness can_be attributed to the higher magnetic stiffness . in contrast , for hexagonal and square grids the values of dop t change so that for ∆ d = 10 % the coercivity for both systems is almost_indistinguishable . iv . conclusions the study of two - dimensional arrays of ferromagnetic nano - particles allowed the determination of the optimal grid parameter dop t that is distinctly_different for triangular , hexagonal and square grids . for larger interparticle_distances triangular_grid is preferable ;BRdavid . t . chuss @_nasa . gov fig . 1 . overview of the vpm concept adapted from chuss et_al . 3 the geometric path difference_between the two polarizations is highlighted by the thick_solid_lines . geometry . 3 in addition , metrology techniques for realizing high_precision_measurements of the vpm response have_been_developed . 4 the primordial inflationary polarization explorer ( piper ) 5 , 6 and the cosmology large angular scale surveyor ( class ) 7 will both employ vpms as the first element of their optics in their measurement of the polarization of the cosmic_microwave_background on large_angular_scales . the motivation for using the vpm is twofold . first , the vpm can_be made large_enough to be placed at the primary aperture of a relevant telescope . this allows sky polarization to be modulated while_leaving any subsequent instrumental contribution to the polarization unmodulated , thereby mitigating potential mixing between temperature and polarization . in addition , the small linear distances ( fraction ofBR] and can_be used in the determination of b ( bs → µ µ ) expt .
