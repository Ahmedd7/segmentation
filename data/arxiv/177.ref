( 3 ) this method does_not_require the value of ρ which is advantageous when totem cannot determine ρ itself and needs to take it from an external_source . • the third method is called luminosity - independent as the inputs are combined in such a way that the formula for σ tot does_not_include the luminosity . moreover , the value of the integrated_luminosity can_be determined as_well : σ tot = 16 π 1 + ρ 2 dnel / dtt = 0 nel + ninel , 1 + ρ 2 16 π l = ( nel + ninel ) 2 dnel / dtt = 0 . ( 4 ) the principle of the elastic_scattering analysis is explained in section 2 . here , we_would_like to outline the measurement of the inelastic event rate ninel , for more_details we refer the reader elsewhere [ 6 , 9 ] . the measurement proceeds in three steps . in the first_step , raw rate is established by counting events with the telescope t2 ( fragments of more_than_95_% of inelastic events are detected ) . in the second_step , one applies corrections to determine visible rate that would_be measured with perfect detector in perfect conditions . these corrections account for trigger and reconstruction inefficiencies , beam - gas background and event pile - up . in the third step , events with no tracks in t2 are recovered : t1 - only events , events with rapidity_gap over t2 , low - mass diffraction and central diffraction withoutBR84 30 . 0 2 . 6 : 1 . 8 : 1 + [ 24 , 3 , 1 ] 1 . 24 4 . 5 3 . 1 : 1 . 2 : 1 [ 24 , 4 , 0 ] 1 . 25 8 . 9 3 . 4 : 1 . 4 : 1 + 0 50 0 in what_follows we investigate the survival ( or appearance ) of the su ( 3 ) symmetry systematically as a function of the quadrupole_deformation ( including triaxiality ) . we do_so in terms of the nilsson - model combined with the concept of the quasi - dynamical symmetry , discussed in the previuos section . we obtain the shape isomers from a selfconsistent calculation concerning the quadrupole_deformation . in particular : one varies systematically the parameters ( β in , γ in ) , as an input for the nilsson - model . the calculations provide_us_with the effective u ( 3 ) quantum_numbers , which can_be translated_into the ( β out , γ out ) quadrupole_deformation , since they are uniquely related to each_other [ 30 ] . then one can check if the selfconsistency is satisfied , as_well as the question_whether or not the result is stable with_respect_to the ( small ) changes of the input values . this method for the determination of the shape isomers is an_alternative to the standard energy - minimum calculation and has_been_shown to be effective for a range of light_nuclei [ 31BRµ with associated ghp lie_derivative and only if , there_exists a ghp tetrad zm operator l ξ which commutes_with the ghp operators ( io , io ′ , ∂ , ∂ ′ ) when acting_on an_arbitrary { 0 , 0 } weighted scalar η , and its companion equations . h l ξ , ioi η = 0 , 5 ( 7 ) ( b ) furthermore , with_respect_to any killing_vector ξ , the commutator equations ( 7 ) are also satisfied when η is any { p , q } weighted scalar , or indeed any tensor . the following theorems ( theorems 4 and 5 in [ 16 ] ) provide the key tools , when the spacetime under_consideration contains an intrinsic ghp tetrad . theorem 4 .
