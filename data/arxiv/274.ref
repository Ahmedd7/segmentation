divisors , in [ bfj08 ] and [ bdff12 ] the authors defined nef weil b - divisors and the nef envelope . independently , in [ urb12a ] , motivated_by the pullback for weil_divisors defined in [ dfh09 ] , the second_author introduced nef weil_divisors . these two definitions arise_naturally and have good properties in many_different_ways . our motivation for studying positivity for reflexive_sheaves comes_from the minimal model program , and the properties described in [ urb12a ] seem to be more connected with our scope . in this_paper , starting_from the second approach , we define ( relative ) nefness , amplitude , bigness and pseudo - effectiveness for weil_divisors , and we prove most of the properties one_would_expect from such definitions ( vanishing , non - vanishing , and global generation theorems ) . 1 2 alberto chiecchio and stefano urbinatiBRacquire the symmetry of the eg_orbitals of the ni in the collapsed d8l2 octahedron , which therefore becomes formally equivalent to a 3d6 state that is effectively no_longer jt active , and attains a spin of zero . thus , as far as symmetry and spin are concerned , this new charge state appears as a fully cd state , but one achieved without actual movement of charge . we note_that a similar charge / spin distribution was proposed in refs . 17 , 18 , but as being driven by very_different mechanisms . we investigate quasi -
