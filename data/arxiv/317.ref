from the chiral_symmetry_breaking . 5 . summary and discussions in a series of publications , we have explored to unravel the structure of baryonic_matter at high density exploiting skyrme ’_s conjecture . our study includes the lowest_lying vector_mesons ρ and ω in the the hls approach with the lagrangian given up december 10 , 2013 1 : 26 wspc baryonicmatter skyrmions , half - skyrmions and nucleon_mass in dense_baryonic_matter 9 to o ( p4 ) in chiral counting and the leading_order in nc . the lecs of the lagrangian are then determined_by using the master formulas derived_from a class of hqcd models . our results clearly show that the skyrmion and skyrmion matter properties are affected_by the attractive_interaction of theBR- oil capped ( ε ave = 2 . 25 ) , and al2o3 capped ( ε ave = 2 . 57 ) samples , and each curve is adjusted to a similar vertical scale and shifted for better_visualization . the emission peak is at 2 ev , marked by the black_arrow . evidently , the 2p and 3p peak_positions remain roughly unchanged within the experimental error , marked by the grey_bands at 2 . 22 ( ± 0 . 02 ) ev and 2 . 49 ( ± 0 . 02 ) ev , respectively . therefore , the 1s - np ( n = 2 , 3 ) separation is approximately the same as the low - temperature uncapped result ( fig . 2 ) , suggesting the excitation_energy of the low - energy exciton levels are relatively_insensitive to dielectric environmental and temperature perturbations , as discussed in the main_text . b . measured emission spectra at different excitation_energies of an_immersion - oil capped ws2_monolayer at_room_temperature . the horizontal_line signal is the tpl emission , with two hotspots along the line corresponding to the 2p and 3p two - photon_absorption peaks . the ! shg ! signal ! due ! to ! the ! broken ! inversion ! symmetry ! in ! the ! monolayer ! is ! observed !
