( 1 ) if xs = v , then any vertical effective_cartier_divisor on x is equal to div ( λ ) for some non - zero λ ∈ k ◦ . ( 2 ) if xs 6 = v and if all canonical polyhedra with positive - dimensional finite part have the same length v ( π ) , then there is a unique effective_cartier_divisor c on x with cyc ( c ) = v ( π ) v , and any effective_cartier_divisor with support contained in v is equal to n c for a unique n ∈ n . ( 3 ) if v is adjacent to canonical polyhedra ∆ s1 , ∆ s2 with positive - dimensional finite part and whose lengths v ( π 1 ) , v ( π 2 ) are not commensurable , then v is not the support of a cartier_divisor on x . proof . note_that ( 1 ) follows_from the fact that a vertical cartier_divisor on an admissible formal_scheme over k ◦ with reduced special_fibre is uniquely_determined_by the associated weil_divisor ( see proposition a . 7 ) . to prove ( 2 ) , we assume_that xs 6 = v . since x is connected , continuity and surjectivity of the retraction map τ yield that s ( x , h ) is connected . we_conclude from the stratum - face correspondence ■BRcase , the point of the rebuttal reviewed above was to illuminate an apparent double standard lurking in judgments that the maudlin challenge is fatal for ti . rather_than eliminate the double standard by acknowledging that in fact neither apparent problem is a severe one for standard quantum theory or for ti , the author attempts to minimize the double standard by arguing that both apparent problems are severe . specifically , in arguing that the delayed choice experiment presents a severe problem for standard quantum theory , the author claims that this was a motivation for john cramer in developing ti , and invokes cramer_’_s discussion ( 1986 , p . 671 ) of that experiment . but this is misleading . in the cited section , cramer was discussing_how ti can provide an observer - free account of measurement , and pointing_out that including the response of absorbers resolves the alleged involvement of a conscious observer in determining_whether a photon retroactively went_through one or both slits in the delayed choice experiment . thus , clearly cramer_’_s intent was to eliminate the conscious observer and to solve the measurement problem in physical terms , not to claim that the delayed choice experiment specifically posed a severe consistency problem for quantum theory . 8 the other interpretations claimed by the author to solve the measurement problem are the bohmian theory , everettian ( mwi ) approaches , and the grw theory . however , all these interpretations suffer_from serious deficiencies not faced by ti , such as difficulty explaining the born_rule , or what_causes the frankly ad_hoc ‘BRthe lee - yang zero point method for v2 ( η ) and the event - plane method for v2 ( pt ) ) . the paciae 2 . 0 model [ 16 ] is mainly different from ampt sm as follows : 1 . the partonic initial_state is obtained by breaking the strings from pythia in paciae 2 . 0 , but by breaking hadrons from hijing in ampt sm . 2 . the gg_→ gg elastic_scattering_cross_section is utilized in the parton rescattering in ampt sm but specific scattering_cross_section is used for individual qq ( gg ) scattering_processes in paciae 2 . 0 . 3 . in the ampt sm model the partons after rescattering are hadronizedBRso an_sssr ) / interaction of substance of meteorites with the earth [ in russian ] , publ . nauka . siberian department , novosibirsk , 3 - 21 . fesenkov , v . g . , 1964 , concerning a question on a nature of comets . meteoritika , v . 24 , 61 - 65 . florensky , k . p . 1963 , preliminary_results of tunguska meteorite complex expedition ( 1961 ) . meteoritika , 23 , 3 - 29 . glinka , n . l . 1979 , general chemistry . 20 - th edition [ in russian ] . publ . khimiya . len . department . golenetsky , s . p . , stepanok , v . v . , and kolesnikov , e . m . 1977 , indications of cosmochemical anomaly in the region of the tunguska catastrophe ( 1908 ) [ in russian ] . geokhimiya , no . 11 , 1635 – 1645 . 14 hartogh , p . , lis , d . c . , bockel_é_e - morvan , d . , de val - borro , m . , biver , nBR10 20 28 10 0 0 0 33 shift ( hz ) 200 157 0 1 1 1 figure 6 : bistatic range - cut plot for contaminated gaussian_noise using fft in equation ( 11 ) . all targets and clutters are masked .
