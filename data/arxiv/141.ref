UNK UNK d χ d α 1 ( w , sBR∼ 0 . 015 m_⊙ is removed from the companion_stars by the impact of the pure_deflagration explosion of a mch wd . in contrast , the amount of final unbound companion mass is more_than_ten_times larger ( > 0 . 1 m_⊙ ) for the w7 explosion model with the same companion_star models at the same separations . a large_amount of unbound companion mass in the impact simulations for the w7 explosion model seems to indicate that normal_sne_ia are not likely produced from the wd + ms mch explosion scenario ( see also liu_et_al . 2012 ) . here , it is shown that the mass stripping is inefficient for 2002cx - like sne_ia due_to the low kinetic_energies of off - center pure_deflagration explosions of a mch wd , leading to that a amount of unbound companion material caused_by the sn impact is quite_small . therefore , the h lines probably be hidden in late - time spectra of sn_2002cx - like sne_ia . however , whether or 4 fig . 3 . — density distributions of all gas material as a function of the explosion time in the impact simulations for model a . the color scale shows the logarithm of the density in g cm − 3 . the plots are made with the freely_available splash tool ( price 2007 ) . fitting_parameters for equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) table 2 fitting_parameters model c1 α c2 β model a 1 . 169 4 . 345 258 . 7 2 . 354 model b 0 . 251 3 . 003 201 . 9 2 . 254 model c 0 . 923 4 . 153 104 . 8 2 . 100 model d 0 . 279 3 . 300 96 . 8BR2c1l1 ⊗ bbt 2 ≤ im ⊗ [ ap + p at − 2c1 λ min ( l1 ) bbt ] < 0 , ( 16 ) which , together_with ( 15 ) , implies v1 < 0 . therefore , the containment error ξ of ( 7 ) is asymptotically UNK stable , i . e . , the containment_problem is solved . remark 1 . as shown in [ 4 ] , a necessary and sufficient_condition for the existence of a p > 0 to the lmi ( 9 ) is that ( a , b ) is stabilizable . therefore , a sufficient_condition for the existence of ( 3 ) satisfying theorem 1 is that ( a , b ) is stabilizable . remark 2 . the distributed controller ( 3 ) consists of a linear term c1kpn nonlinear term c2g ( kpn j = 1 aij ( xi − xj ) and a j = 1 aij ( xi − xj ) ) , where the nonlinear term is used to suppress the effect of the leaders ’ nonzero inputs . without the nonlinear term in ( 3 ) , it can_be seen from ( 7 ) that even_though k is designed such that im ⊗ a + c1l1 ⊗ bk is hurwitz , the containment error will not converge to zero due_to the nonzero ul . note_that the function g ( · ) in ( 3 ) is nonsmooth , implying that the containment controller ( 3 ) is discontinuous . since the right_hand of ( 3 ) is measurable and locally essentially bounded , the well - posedness and the existence of the solution to ( 7 ) can_be understood in the filippov sense [ 24 ] . 4 continuousBRgeneralpurpose computation on graphics_hardware . computer_graphics_forum , 26 ( 1 ) : 80 – 113 , 2007 .
