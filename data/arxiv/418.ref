[ 17BRthat observed in the parent eufe2as2 compound and consistent_with the results presented in fig . 1 . figure 2 ( c ) shows temperature_dependence of the same ( 2 1 7 ) reflection in an applied_magnetic_field of 0 . 5 t along the [ 1 2 0 ] direction in both scattering channels . it is interesting to see that the temperature_dependence appears in the opposite scattering channel compared to the zero field and indicates a possible flop of the magnetic_moment in an applied_magnetic_field which will be_discussed_later . the transition_temperature is increased from 19 k at zero field to 29 k at 0 . 5 t . to confirm the resonant magnetic behavior of the peaks , we performed energy scans at the eu l3 absorption edge as shown in fig . 3 . we note_that for the ( 2 1 7 ) reflection charge and magnetic peak coincide . an investigation of the magnetic signal which is five to six_orders of magnitude_weaker_than the thomson charge scattering requires significant_reduction of the charge background . the charge background can_be reduced significantly for a reflection with scattering_angle close to 90_◦ [ 43 , 44 ] . since the ( 2 1 7 ) reflection has a scattering_angle of ∼ 94 . 5 ◦ at the eu l3BRquarks via eq . ( 25 ) . and indeed we see that our results are in good_agreement_with what we can expect from the ms masses of quarks , within 20 % in the uds case , and within 10 % in the non - uds cases . the aijk parameters should_be related to the σ ijk − λ ijk splitting via eq . ( 23 ) , and we have good_agreement there , within 15 mev in the uds case , and within 1 mev in the non - uds cases . the aijk parameters should_be related to difference_between 3 the masses of the i and j quarks via eq . ( 29 ) . however , they will also be sensitive to the electromagnetic_interaction , which we neglected in our formalism , and which will affect the results by a few mev . we should therefore expect no better_than order - of - magnitude agreement in the udk multiplets , and good_agreement in the other cases . this is indeed the case . lastly , the generalized gmo formalism accommodates the masses of octet_baryons very_well , with rms_errors under 10 mev . however , in the case of non - uds multiplets , the agreement could_be purely fortuitous , asBRvalues are converted_into equivalent decimal grey values . these grey values are stored in odd - even position to form stego - image . this stego - image is transmitted_through the channel . c . detector algorithm the stego - image ’_s pixel values are treated_as decimal_numbers and converted_into eight bit binary numbers . the stego - image is shared in two parts ( s _ img1 and s _ img2 ) with odd - even positioned pixel grey values . 98 international_conference_on computation and communication advancement ( ic3a ) - 2013 stego_key image stego_key image s _ key img 1 s _ key img 2 s _ key img 1 s _ key img 2 embedding algo ( sBRgalactic_magnetic_fields and matter ( i . e . atoms , ions and molecules ) spread between the stars constitute a complex dynamic plasma , known asthe interstellar_medium ( ism ) . the density and temperature of the particles and the magnitude of the fields are fundamental parameters that shape the structure of the interstellar environment and characterize its evolution . earlier_studies ( for a review see e . g . ferri_`_ere 2001 ; cox 2005 ) have pointed_out the presence of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence in the ism , which is responsible_for the distribution and the dissipation of energy through a wide_range of spatial_scales . mhd_turbulence is thought to play_an_essential_role for many send_offprint_requests to : m . iacobelli key interstellar processes ( for a review see e . g . elmegreen_&_scalo 2004 ) , including star_formation ( see krumholz_&_mckee 2005 ; mckee_&_ostriker_2007 ) , cosmic_ray_propagation ( see schlickeiser 2011 ; lazarian et_al . 2011 ) and magnetic_reconnection ( see lazarian_&_vishniac 1999 ) . additionally , astrophysical mhd_turbulence is an integral part of the dynamics of the galaxy , providing a significant pressure ( and energy_density ) to support the diffuse_ism ( boulares & cox 1990 ) . many_efforts_have_been made overBRlarge_enough n , ar ( n , l ∪ tp2 ) and ar ( n , l ∪ kp3 ) for any large_enough t and k , and a graph l satisfying some conditions . consequently , we determine ar ( n , g ) , for large_enough n , where g is p3 ∪ tp2 for any t ≥ 3 , p4 ∪ tp2 and c3 ∪ tp2 for any t ≥ 2 , kp3 for any k ≥ 3 , tp2 ∪ kp3 for any t ≥ 1 , k ≥ 2 , and pt + 1 ∪ kp3 for any t ≥ 3 , k ≥ 1 . furthermore , we obtain upper and lower_bounds for ar ( n , g ) , for large_enough n , where g is pk + 1 ∪ tp2 and ck ∪ tp2 for any k ≥ 4 , t ≥ 1 . keywords_: anti - ramsey , multicoloured , rainbow . 1 introduction defininiton . a subgraph of an edge - coloured_graph is called multicoloured if each of its edges has a distinct colour . let g be a ( simple ) graph . for any integer n ≥ v ( g ) , let ar ( n , g ) be the minimal integer r such that in any edge - colouring of kn by at_least r colours there isBRtime and it has enough time for waiting the existence of the potential minimum at the late - time . this leads to the stabilization of the extra_dimensions eventually . unfortunately , the form of aether field which can provide this viable model is not stable [ 21 – 24 ] . it is important to note_that there is another class of study in stabilizing mechanism of the extra_dimensions from casimir_energy [ 25 – 27 ] . the casimir_energy from this model can also play the role of cosmological_constant the drive the late - time acceleration of the universe . in this_paper , we will seek for another_way to restore the stabilizing mechanism by considering the modification of gravity instead of adding an exotic_matter field . for the modified_gravity , we will consider the generalization of einstein_gravity namely “ lovelock_gravity " [ 28 – 30 ] . lovelock_gravity is a generalization of einstein_gravity in higher - dimensional_spacetime while_keeping the full einstein_gravity with cosmological_constant in four - dimensional_spacetime . one of important properties of this modified_gravity is that it still provides the second_order derivative of the equations of motion and satisfies the conservation_equation of matter field or , in other_words , satisfies of the modified bianchi_identity . in five and six - dimensional_spacetime , lovelock_gravity theory is reduced to einstein - gauss -
