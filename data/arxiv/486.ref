introduced during the fabrica4 tensively studied yet , memcapacitors and meminductors9 can also be used in the above memcomputing schemes by replacing memristors , albeit in a modified form . since memcapacitors and meminductors may in principle be constructed to consume little or virtually_no energy , their use in memcomputing is potentially energetically more_efficient_than the use of memristors . an_important_milestone in this field would_be the demonstration of a memcomputing device with computing capabilities and power_consumption comparable to ( or better_than ) those of the human_brain . iv . application of memristive_networks to the shortest - path problem we now provide an_explicit example of computing with memelements – specifically with memristive_networks – in order to exemplify even further the criteria given above , and the possibilities_offered_by this paradigm . details of the specific memristive_systems used and the simulation details can_be found in the methods section . the memristive network ( processor ) consists of a square array of grid_points connected by basic units involving two bipolar memristive elements and two switches ( see fig . 2 ) . although not strictly_necessary , in this example we have chosen the design of each basic unit to be symmetric so as to conveniently provide independency of the circuit operation on the sign of the applied_voltage . the switches are introduced for two functions : iBR( s , ξ ) are similar , which completes the proof of the lemma . UNK lemma 5 . 4 . the bound ( 5 . 6 ) holds provided that ( 5 . 5 ) holds and , in addition , max ( k − k1 , k − k2 , k − k3 ) ≥ 21 , max ( k1 − k3 , k2 − k3 ) ≥ 5 and min ( k1 , k2 ) ≤ − 48m 100 . ( 5 . 19 ) proof of lemma 5 . 4 . by symmetry we may_assume that k2 = min ( k1 , k2 ) . the main observation is that we still have the strong lower_bound ( ∂ η φ ) ( ξ , η , σ ) = − λ ′ ( ξ + η ) + λ ′ ( ξ + η + σ ) & 2 − kmax / 2 . this is easy to see since ξ ≥ 2 − 31 , ξ + σ ≤ 2k2 + 1 , and ξ + η ≈ 2k1 . integrating by parts in in l2BR( x ) . for di , dj , dk ≤ 1 we obtain the number of edges connected to nodes which have certain sockets . iii . expected graph evolution consider transmission over the bec and pd [ 8 ] . we start the pd algorithm by removing the variable nodes and their edges associated_with non - erased_symbols and any disconnected check nodes from the graph ; following this , one deg1 check node and its linked variable node are removed from the reduced graph per_iteration . in [ 8 ] , it was shown that the sequence of graphs follows a typical path or expected evolution . based_on the graph covariance evolution as a function of the code length at those points where the expected evolution of the fraction of deg1 check nodes presents a local_minimum ( critical_points ) , scaling_laws ( sls ) predict the finite - length performance of code ensembles in the waterfall region in [ 7 ] . in this section , we show_how to compute the graph expected evolution for the ( l , r , l ) p ensemble . the pd is initialized by removing from the graph all bits correctly_received . therefore , each variable node is removed from the graph with probability ( 1 −  ) . denote by ł ( x , t = 0 ) and r ( x , t = 0 ) the expected graph dd after this step . it can_be easily_checked that ł ( xBR( t ) z ek + 1 xk = 0 z ek + 1 − c θ , φ ( t ) xk = 0 z e xk = 0 z e − c θ , φ ( t ) xk = 0 = c θ , φ ( t ) z e xk = 0 − c θ , φ ( t ) z e xk = 0 n − 1 n − 1 n − 1 1 1 1 1 ( a − xekei θ b ) − 1b + φ , k ( x ) x1 − θ + ite ( 1 − θ ) keiktei θ b u ( a − xeke − i θ b ) − 1b − φ , k ( x ) x1 − θ + ite ( 1 − θ ) keikte − i θ b u dx x dx x , where φ , k ( x ) = ( x − 1e − kb ) φ ( x − 1e − kb + e ± i θ b ) − 1 . b ± if we take the lp norm , with the same p as in the t -BRat the top of the plot where p ≈ 1 and the frequency is close to 100_% . ) the heat map b in fig . 2 illustrates a typical case of what_happens_when the aps citation graph is randomized but the time ordering of publications is preserved . the number of terms with a non - zero meme_score decreases_dramatically ( from ≈ 1 . 4 million in map a to just 89 , 356 in map b ) , the universal distribution pattern of scientific memes vanishes , and the top - right part , where the top - ranked memes should_be located , disappears_completely . naturally , if the aps citation graph is randomized without preserving the time ordering , the overlap with the original results presented in map a is even smaller ( see_supplementary_material ) . statistical_analysis reveals that median values of the meme_score obtained with theBR1 / 2 + 5 / 2 + 3 / 2 + 1 / 2 + 5 / 2 + 3 / 2 + 5 / 2 + 3 / 2 + 7 / 2 + 9 / 2 + 5 / 2 + 23occeiexp . usd0123456780 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 2 + 1 + ? 0 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 24o 4 fig . 3 .

( 2014 ) studied the fine spatial structures of the extinction features in the cnr of m31 . we present the swift and hst_observations , and the data reduction in § 2 . we describe our method to derive the line - of - sight locations and the extinction_curves in § 3 , apply it to the dusty_clumps in m31 ’_s cnr in § 4 and present the results in § 5 . we discuss the implications of our results in § 6 and conclude the paper in § 7 . 2 . data 2 . 1 . hst_wfc3 and acs observations we utilize images_taken by hst_wfc3 and acs in ten bands ( see tableBR) is 1 . 0 for the homogeneous model , approaches 1 for highly regular structures like α - helices and goes to zero for non - repetitive structures . in figure 7 a variety of proteins are ranked by their_respective tileability score ξ ( table s1 ) . the largest value of ξ is obtained for a long α - helix from a coiled coil . the helix is followed_by several solenoidal proteins with the most regular designed proteins ranking higher_than the more irregular natural ones . these structures are followed_by repetitive proteins with an overall globular shape . at the end of this scale we find typical globular domains that do_not have any periodicity larger_than a few residues . we note_that not all members of a particular topology group together , they rather get segregated according_to the irregularities they display ( fig . 7 ) . the same tiling procedure can_be applied at the level of protein_complexes , analyzing the details of how fragment copies between chains cover the structural space . at this level we found that the best tiles often correspond with the monomeric chains or classical globular domains within them . however interesting exceptions can mark chains that can_be further_decomposed_into smaller units ( fig 6 ) . it will be appealing to extend this now limited survey and characterize how_frequently the distribution of geometric tiles coincide_with the polypeptide_chains , globular domains , exonsBRdy = npart [ ( 1 − fcore ( npart ) ) d2n corona 2 π . pt . dpt . dy i i 2 π . pt . dpt . dy ] . + fcore ( npart ) d2n core ( 2 ) unfortunately in the low_energy beam scan proton - proton_collisions have_not_been measured . we therefore have to use the spectrum of the most peripheral reactions together_with fcore to extract the spectrum for proton - proton_collisions . the spectrum for the negative charged_particles k − ( top ) , π − ( middle ) and antiproton ( bottom ) ( those for the positive charged_particles cannot_be displayed due_to space limitation ) , produced in auau_collisions at √ s = 39 agev and 11 . 5 agev ( kumar 2011 and zhu 2012 ) , are shown for different_centralities in figs . 2 and 5 , respectively . we observe in both_cases a quite nice_agreement_with the corecorona predictions which are shown in the same graph . to quantify this agreement we divide in figs . 3 and 6 the spectra at a given centrality by the most central spectrum . this quantity we dubbed rcp . this presentation displays clearly whether the slope of the spectra changes as a function of the centrality and whether the core - corona model is able_to reproduce this eventual change . we see
