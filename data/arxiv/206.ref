( 7 ) note_that an hermitian_symmetric space of compact type is an example of compact hodge manifold with b2 ( m ) = 1 . it is worth_pointing_out_that there_exist many examples of manifolds satisfying the assumption of theorem 1 which are not symmetric . in the symmetric case inequalities ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are equalities ( see [ 9 ] for a proof ) and we_believe that this holds_true also in the non symmetric cases . to this respect some_remarks_on the gromov_width of homogeneous hodge manifolds 3 recall a conjecture due_to p . biran which asserts_that π is a lower_bound for the gromov_width of any closed integral symplectic_manifold . the paper contains two other sections . in section 2 we summarize lu ’_s work on pseudo symplectic_capacities and their links with gromov –_witten_invariants needed in the proof of our_mainBRet_al .

( 4 ) if we consider a single_photon with hi polarization in a1 spatial mode . this photon combined with the coherent_state hi α i will evolve to hi α e − i θ i . on the other_hand , the v i polarization in a1 spatial mode combined with the coherent_state v i α i will evolve to v i α ei θ i . therefore , by measuring the phase_shift of the coherent_state , we can judge the single_photon number . in this way , we_do_not_need to detect the single_photon directly . it is so called the quantum_nondemolition ( qnd ) measurement , which has_been_widely_used in quantum_information_processing [ 43 – 47 ] . from fig . 2 , suppose that alice and bob_share two pairs of the mixed_states in the spatial modes a1 , b1 and a2 , b2 , respectively . the mixed_state ρ can_be described in eq .
