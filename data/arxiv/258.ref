( 17 ) . thus , for small reynolds_numbers , the velocity of the robot scales_linearly_with the frequency of tail rotations 24 and its body size ; therefore there is no need to conduct additional simulations for frequency dependence and the radius of the body . for swimmers with helical tails , hydrodynamic model results are compared with cfd_simulation results in figs .BRwe represent both effects by the length l . the upper wave_vector cutoff is given by the inverse of the elastic mean free_path l = √ 2d τ , above which electron dynamics is ballistic rather_than diffusive . here d = v2 f τ / 2 is the diffusion_coefficient . the weight factor ( w ) in eq . 8 specifies_how each cooperon channel contributes to the conductivity , and is defined by w µ ′ µ ν ′ ν = 1 ω xk ( g − vx g + ) ν ′ µ ( k ) ( g + vx g − ) µ ′ ν ( − k ) . ( 9 ) since the original hamiltonian is isotropic , the matrix structure of w is not changed by coordinate rotations which replace vx by velocity in some other direction . the cooperon factor ( γ ( q ) ) in eq . 8 is defined as an_infinite sum of ladder_diagrams , γ ( q ) = γ ω + γ ω ω p ( q ) γ ω + γ ω ω p ( q ) γ ω ω p ( q ) γ ω + ·_·_· .
