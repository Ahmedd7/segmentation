. let n be the number of divisors of k . then by remark 3 . 2 , each vertex of g has some set - indexing number di , which is a divisor of k . hence , v ( g ) can_be partitioned_into at_most n sets , say ( x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) where each xi consists of the vertices of g having the set - indexing number di . let_us_now_proceed to discuss the admissibility of strongly uniform iasis by certain graphs and conditions required for their existence for various graphs . the following theorem establishes the admissibility of strongly uniform iasis by bipartite_graphs . theorem 3 . 4 . for any_positive_integer k , all bipartite_graphs admit a strongly k - uniform_iasi . proof .BRπ λ 0 π t = 1 ( l + 1 ) ! x π ln λ 0 = ln λ 0 . ( 84 ) it_follows then that if λ 0 is replaced_by λ ∗ , the value of the objective_function is reduced without_violating the constraint , and so , λ ∗ cannot_be worse_than λ 0 . now , for an ( l + 1 ) × ( l + 1 ) matrix λ whose_entries_are ρ ij = ρ + ( 1 − ρ ) δ i − j ( δ k being the kronecker_delta_function ) , the eigenvalues are easily found to be λ 1 = 1 + ρ l ( with an eigenvector being the all – one vector ) and λ 2 = . . . = λ l + 1 = 1 − ρ ( with l independent eigenvectors , all orthogonal to the all – one vector ) . therefore , and so , the expurgated exponent function becomes ln λ = ln ( 1 + ρ l ) + l ln ( 1 − ρ )BRtwo i , j − = pi σ − i , level atoms j z = pi σ z when all the n atoms are in the ground_state , then j = n / 2 , jz = − n / 2 , because the total spin j 2 = j 2 x + j 2 z is a conserved_quantity , by confining the hilbert_space only to j = n / 2 , then one reduces the hilbert_space from 2n to 2j + 1 = n + 1 . one can call the resulting model as the j − u ( 1 ) / z2 dicke_model . one main_advantage of this reduction is that one can study the j − u ( 1 ) / z2 model by using holstein - primakoff ( hp ) representation of the angular_momentum operator jz = b † b − j , j + = b † √ 2j − b † b , j − = √ 2j − b † bb , therefore treat photon and atom on the same footings . this advantage will_enable_us_to bring_out many new and important results hard to retrieve from the 1 / n expansion in27 . very fortunately , this reduction will not change the most_important physics of the original u ( 1 ) / z2 model eqn . 1 . as argued in supplementary_materials b and explicitly shown in31 , except the u ( 1 ) / z2 dicke_model contains some additional energy_levels , both models share the same other physical_quantities to be studiedBRnon euclidean_space forms . the main_idea in this sense is to study codazzi pairs ( i , ii ) as a geometric object in a non standard way on a riemannian_surface ( σ , i ) of non positive gauss_curvature and use this study to deduce consequences when ( i , ii ) are the first and second_fundamental forms of a surface immersed in a space form . we_shall follow the same approach as introduced by aledo , espinar and g_´_alvez , [ 2 ] . as in the previous_sections , we_shall assume_that σ is an oriented_surface ( otherwise we would work with its oriented two - sheeted_covering ) . moreover , throughout we always consider a c ∞ - differentiability . definition 4 . a fundamental pair on σ is a pair of real quadratic_forms ( i , ii ) on σ , where i is a riemannian_metric . the shape operator a of ( i , ii ) is defined by ii ( x , y ) = i ( ax , y ) , x , y ∈ t σ . ( 4 . 1 ) we also define the mean_curvature , the extrinsic_curvature and the principal_curvatures of the pair ( i , ii ) as one half of the trace , the determinant and the eigenvalues of the endomorphism a . it is remarkable that , in general , there is not any connection_between the extrinsic_curvature of a fundamental pair ( i , ii ) and the gauss_curvature k ( i ) of the riemannian_metric i .BR( 201 , 202 , 203 , 204 ) ( 205 , 206 , 207 , 208 ) ( 209 , 210 , 211 , 212 ) ( 213 , 214 , 215 , 216 ) ( 217 , 218 , 219 , 220 ) ( 221 , 222 , 223 , 224 ) ( 225 , 226 , 227 , 228 ) ( 229 , 230 , 231 , 232 ) ( 233 , 234 , 235 , 236 ) ( 237 , 238 , 239 , 240 ) .
