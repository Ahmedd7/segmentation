UNK = ei ( γ − ε ) f ψ UNK UNK . so ψ UNK UNK UNK is on the same ( opposite ) sublattice as ψ UNK UNK if ε = 0 ( ε = π ) . this can_be written succintly as a , π − n UNK n UNK UNK a , 0 − n UNK n UNK UNK b , π = n UNK UNK a , 0 = n UNK UNK b , π − n UNK b , 0 − n UNK a , π = 0 ; b , 0 = 0 . ( a2a ) ( a2b ) using eqs . ( a2 ) to simplify ν UNK + ν UNK UNK and ν UNK − ν UNK UNK from eqs . ( a1 ) , we obtain ν UNK + ν UNK UNK ν 0 = 2 ; ν π = ν UNK − ν UNK UNK 2 , ( a3 ) which are eqs . ( 10 ) we set out to demonstrate . appendix b : geometrical_picture for a two - band 1d floquet insulator with cs , we can give a direct geometrical_picture for the topological_invariants ν 0 and ν π . since the global phase cannot wind ( f cannot have quasienergy winding ) , it can_safely be disregarded , and the evolution operator for the first half of the period then reads f ( k ) = e − i UNK f ( k ) UNK σ . here UNK f is a 3 - dimensional vector , of magnitude f ∈ [ 0 , π ] and UNK σ the vector of pauli_matrices . the k - dependent vector UNK f ( k ) isBRtcr ≪ mcrc2 is satisfied , i . e . cosmic_rays are cold . another condition that simplifies the treatment considerably is to assume the wavelength of perturbations to be much_larger_than the thermal larmor_radius of particles ρ j 1 ≫ ρ 2 i ∇ 2 , ( 16 ) 1 ≫ ρ 2 cr γ cr0 UNK γ 2 cr0 ∂ 2 ∂ x2 + ∂ 2 ∂ y2 UNK , where ρ i ∼ ( ti0 / mi ω 2 ci ) 1 / 2 and ρ cr = cscr / ω ccr ( see equations ( a41 ) and ( b11 ) ) . the additional conditions for cosmic_rays simplifying their contribution to a current will be – 13 – given below . the third simplification is to consider perturbations along and across the cosmic - ray velocity ucr separately . the first case is simpler . therefore , we begin with its consideration . 5 . the case ∂ ∂ y 6 = 0 , ∂ ∂ x = 0 using equation ( a56 ) and performing calculations of the corresponding quantities , we find the components of the plasma dielectric_permeability tensor ( vi0y has_been changed by upl ) ε plxx = − ∂ ∂ y UNK 2 UNK ∂ ∂ t UNK − 2 g1 + g3 ∂ t ω 2 pi ω 2 ω 2 pi ω 2 ci + upl ci UNK ∂ mi UNK ti0 + te0 − 1 d ∂ ∂ t − g2 + g4 d UNK ∂ ∂ t + upl ∂ ∂ y UNK UNK ∂ 2 ∂ y2 UNK ∂ ∂ tBRof σ [ 8 ] . a . modified ls algorithm for prediction tasks although the kronecker structure of video space - time covariance_matrices is strong , the diagonal_elements of any covariance_matrix are strongly_affected_by any uncorrelated_noise in the system [ 8 ] , which does_not replicate across the matrix in a kronecker fashion . hence , for example , the kronecker estimate will overestimate positive in - frame correlations . since the diagonal_elements of a covariance_matrix are highly important for determining the inverse of the matrix and by extension the predictor coefficients , this can cause a significant loss of accuracy . to correct this problem , we thus propose to approximate the covariance using the r + 1 - kronecker model + i ⊗ u ti ⊗ si σ ≈ UNK UNK r UNK ( 5 ) i = 1 where u is diagonal [ 8 ] . since the diagonal addition is arbitrary , it does_not_matter what values the kronecker portion assigns to the diagonal_elements . hence we set them as don_’_t cares in the leastsquares low separation rank approximation . we thus turn to the estimation of t and s from the sample_covariance_matrix r with the diagonal_elements of t ⊗ s being don_’_t cares . following rearrangement of r to form b as in [ 11 ] , this becomes the problemBR( c 1 . 4 1 . 3 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 0 . 9 0 1 . 4 1 . 3 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 0 . 9 0 1 . 4 1 . 3 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 0 . 9 0 alice pbpb @ 2 . 76_atev 0 . 3 < k t < 0 . 4 ( gev / c ) 0 . 05 0 . 1 ( gev / c ) q out 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 - 5 % + π + π + π + π 5 - 10 % + π + π + π + π 10 - 20 % 20 - 30 % + π + π + π + π + π + π 30 - 40 % 40 - 50_% 50 - 60 % 0 . 05 0 . 1 q side ( gev / c ) 0 . 15 0 . 2 alice preliminary 0 . 05 0 . 1 q long ( gev / c ) 0 . 15 0 . 2 0 0 c 1 . 4 1 . 3 1 . 2 1 . 1 1 0 0 2 c 0 . 08 0 . 06 0 . 04 0 . 02 0 - 0 . 02 - 0 . 04 - 0 . 06 - 0 . 08 0 2 2 c 0 . 08 0 . 06 0 . 04 0 . 02 0 - 0 . 02 - 0 . 04 - 0 . 06 - 0 . 08 0 0BRindia , december 10 - 12 1984 , pp . 175 - 179 . ieee_press , new_york 2 . yang , y . g . , wen , q . y . , zhu , f . c . : an efficient two - step quantum key distribution protocol with orthogonal product states . chin . phys . 16 ( 4 ) , 910 - 914 ( 2007 ) . 3 . hillery , m . , buzek , v . , berthiaume , a . : quantum_secret_sharing . phys . rev . a 59 ( 3 ) , 1829 - 1834 ( 1999 ) . doi_: 10 . 1103_/_physreva . 59 . 1829 eqau 4 . xu , j . , chen , h . w . , liu , w . j . , liu , z . h . : selection of unitary_operations in quantum_secret_sharing without entanglement . sci . china inf . sci . 54 ( 9 )BRj } ∪ ancestors ( j ) , that is , the set of all nodes along the ancestral path from j to the root . recall that leaf ( x ) is the unique leaf_node in t such that x ∈ bleaf ( x ) . if the test point x ∈ bx leaf ( x ) ( i . e . , x lies_within the ‘ gray_rectangle ’ at the leaf_node ) , it can never branch off ;

( 9 ) is only exact when all local ( 6 ) and non - local integrals of motion ( i . e . projections_onto eigenstates ) are included . but on rather general_grounds , one can argue_that eigenstates become_irrelevant for local observables in the thermodynamic_limit [ 29 , 42 ] . for short_range correlations one can even go one step further and truncate the series to contain few terms . in the considered case the amplitudes of the contributions of higher_order terms decay_rapidly and already the first few are sufficient to obtain accurate results . to demonstrate this we stick to the extended ensemble UNK · UNK • = UNK · UNK ext . in which all terms with α ≤ 0 in eq . ( 9 ) vanish by definition . for the experimentally_relevant parity - parity correlations the first relevant term in the 4 fig .BRfunction of electron energy . for this analysis we will_focus on a and a since closed_form expressions can_be obtained for limits on tensor couplings and they have the highest sensitivity to λ . the method used to extract the correlation_coefficient and the energy range of the analysis will impact the sensitivity to b , as will be shown explicitly in the case of a . note : we are also explicitly ignoring imaginary couplings and the affect of tensor and scalar_couplings on the angular_correlations a and a , which are second_order in cs and ct . 3 table i . the statistical weighting and ratio of the phase - space factors is presented for each of the 13 isotopes used in the 0 + → 0 + superallowed dataset to calculate the average ft value . ik ( x0 ) are the statistical rate functions defined in eq . 4 and calculated by towner and hardy [ 9 , 10 ] . isotope 10c 14o 22mg 34ar 26alm 34cl 38km 42sc 46v 50mn 54co 62ga 74rb average f t 3067 . 7 ( 4 . 6 ) 3071 . 5 ( 3 . 3 ) 3078 . 0 ( 7 . 4 ) 3069 . 6 ( 8 . 5 ) 3072 . 4 ( 1 . 4 ) 3070 .BR( j − t ) λ ( l ) __________ ( l = j − t ) ( l = j ) ( otherwise ) , γ l µ = γ j λ − t γ j − t λ + t γ j λ __________ ( l = j − t ) ( l = j ) ( otherwise ) . so λ and µ have the same t - weighted s - quotient . for the ‘ if ’ part , assume_that λ and µ have the same t - weighted s - quotient . since cors λ and λ have the same s - set ( by definition ) and the s - quotient of cors λ has all components equals to ∅ , we see that cors λ and cors µ also have the same t - weighted s - quotient . so by proposition 3 . 2 cors λ and cors µ have the same t - core ξ , and lie in the same level t orbit as ξ ; that is , there are w , x ∈ ws such that wcors λ = ξ = xcors µ . by lemma 3 . 1 ( 4 ) we have cors ( w λ ) = ξ = cors ( x µ ) , so by replacing
