( 3 . 5 ) ( 3 . 6 ) if the second class is nonempty , it would_be interesting to find examples of nonhomotopic polyadic_systems . the hossz_´_u - gluskin theorem considers the homotopic polyadic_systems and gives one of the possible_choices for the “ extended ” homotopy maps ψ i in ( 3 . 3 ) . we will show that this choice can_be extended ( “ deformed ” ) to the infinite “ q - series ” .BR≤ m . it is clear that ϕ is a b [ t ] / ( tm + 1 ) – valued point of ( w / s ) if and only if the corresponding ( bi , j ) defines a b – valued point of z . hence ( x / s ) m ∼ = z . s w = s α w α . we have seen that ( w α / s ) m exists for every m ≥ 0 . let π α given w an_arbitrary s – scheme of finite type , we consider an affine_open_cover m : ( w α / s ) m → w α be the canonical_projection . for every α and β , we write w α β = w α ∩ w β . the inverse_image ( π α m ) − 1 ( w α β ) are canonically_isomorphic since they are isomorphic to ( w α β / s ) m . hence we can construct a scheme ( w / s ) m by gluing the schemes ( w α / s ) m along their overlaps . moreover , the projections π α m ) − 1 ( w α β ) and ( π β m glue to give an s – morphism π m : ( w / s ) m → w . it is clear that ( w / s ) m is the mth relative jet scheme of w over s .
