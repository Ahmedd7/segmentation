sharealike . 3 4 . 2 increase in deleted_questions over time we now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted_questions on_stack_overflow . figure 2 shows the ratio of deleted_questions to total questions in each month over a 49 -

operations . for ¯ l being an immersed_lagrangian , we need to consider the extra deformation directions brought by lagrangian smoothings of the immersed points of l . note_that each immersed point of l give two independent ways of lagrangian smoothings . these smoothings is classically known , see for instance thomas - yau [ ty02 ] . to be more_precise , consider the fiber_product l × ι l : = { ( p , q ) ∈ l × l : ι ( p ) = ι ( q ) } which consists of several connected_components , one of them being the diagonal { ( p , p ) ∈ l × l } ∼ = l . let r be a set of labels of the connected_components , and suppose 0 ∈ r labels the diagonal . other_than 0 ∈ r , elements in r can_be identified as ordered_pairs ( p − , p + ) ∈ l × l such that ι ( p − )BRbecomes independent of the dark_matter mass . we call that region the ultra - heavy regime , as it opens_up for masses above 105 gev . notice_that ω h2 ∝ g2 s except in the ultra - heavy regime , where ω h2 ∝ g4 s . the reason for this behavior is that in this regime dark_matter is dominantly_produced via h2h2 -
