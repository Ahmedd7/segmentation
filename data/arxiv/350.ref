because of the inefficiency of h2 cooling . therefore , the characteristic cooling times of these halos is longer ( or comparable ) to their dynamical times , making_them more_akin to hot - mode halos . this is consistent_with the clear virial shocks that we see in these halos ( e . g . , figure 2 ) . to determine if the suppression mechanism could function if we artificially suppressed h2 cooling , we reran one of the simulations with a high lw background ( j21 = 105 ) , well above the critical flux required to suppress h2 cooling radiatively ( shang , bryan &_haiman 2010 ; wolcott - green , haiman &_bryan 2011 ) . we showed_that , in this case , the gas did indeed enter the “ zone of no return ” . to see if this situation was stable , we ran two variations of this simulation , in which we turned the flux off either just_before , or just after the gas in the halo center entered the “ zone of no return ” . in the first case , cooling eventually won out , with the region just_outside the core cooling first and driving an evaporative wind which led to cooling by h2 throughout the halo . however , in the second case , the gas inside the “ zone of no return ” stayed there ,BR, k + k − , k 0 ¯ k 0 which account 83 . 4 % of the hvp contribution to the muon g − 2 . contributions from the missing channels 4 π , 5 π , 6 π , η π π , ω π and from higher_energies we evaluate using data directly and pqcd in the perturbative region and in the tail . the resulting bhls prediction for alo , had allows_us_to get a bhls driven sm_prediction for a µ ( see ta µ ble 1 ) . our favored evaluation based_on selected data yields alo had = µ = ( 11659170 . 28 ± 5 . 96 ) · 10 − 10 ( 681 . 23 ± 4 . 51 ) · 10 − 10 and a prediction athe and ∆ a µ = aexp . the associated fit probability is 94 % and the significance for ∆ a µ is 4 . 4 σ . including all data , applying appropriate rewightingBR= 2ftr , α = 5 figure 4 . l2_norm between the observed and target color bin counts with length regularization . we used 100 bins per channel , λ app = 1 and λ length = 1 . the background were_obtained from the ground_truth segments . we used 100 bins per color channel . the images in the experiments below are taken from [ 21 ] . l2 distance constraint on bin counts : figure 4 shows results of segmentation with l2 distance constraint between the observed and target bin counts regularized by length . the regional term in this case is UNK UNK UNK UNK k UNK r ( s ) = ( UNK fi , s UNK − qi ) 2 . i = 1 since the level sets method was forced to stop after 15000 iterationsBRcalculated error_bars to the final lightcurve rms . the photometric error_bars were then rescaled by a factor cf = β r × β w for the final analysis . the minimal photometric baseline variation necessary to correct for photometric trends was assumed to be a 2nd - order time polynomial , and an offset at the meridian flip for the trappist lightcurves . for the trappist data observed on 28 september_2013 , a significant_improvement was_found by additionally including a 1storder coordinate dependence . 3 . 2 . 3 . radial_velocities to compensate for rv_jitter affecting the coralie data , we added 10 . 4 m s − 1 quadratically to the coralie error_bars . the harps_data did_not_require any additional jitter . the rv zero points were_fitted via minimization at each mcmc step . the inferences_drawn from the rossiter - mclaughlin_effect are highly_sensitive to any potential rv offsets around the time of transit , as can_be caused_by stellar_activity . throughout the harps rv sequence obtained during the transit of 29 aug 2013 , we obtained simultaneous photometric_observations from eulercam and trappist that serve to detect spot - crossing events as_well as add information on the precise_timing of the transit contact points . no signatures of spot - crossing events are visible in the photometry , in line with the low log r UNK hk activity index observed . to test for any potential rv offset that may still be present , we treated the harps_data obtained during the night of transit ( 25 in - , and 3 out -BRthis_paper we outline the basic steps in our derivation and present the final form of the hamiltonian . major elements of the derivation are presented in the appendix . additional details and expanded discussion can_be found in our recent_publication [ 18 ] . in the upcoming_publication [ 19 ] we will provide a detailed_comparison of our_approach with [ 20 ] which appeared simultaneously with the first version of the present_paper . the jimwlk_hamiltonian defines a two - dimensional non - local field_theory of a unitary_matrix ( wilson_line ) s ( x ) which , in the high_energy eikonal_approximation represents the scattering_amplitude of a quark at the transverse_coordinate x . the leading_order hamiltonian is : h lo jimw lk = z d2z d2x_d2y k lo ( x , y , z ) UNK j a l ( x ) j a l ( y ) + j a r (BR0 v 0 - 10 - 5 0 energy 5 10 figure 6 : transmission_spectrum of systems a and b at the bias_voltages including 0 . 0 , 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 and 2 . 0 v at zero gate_voltage 11 2 1 . 5 1 0 . 5 ) e c n a t c u d n o c ( g 0 - 4 system a ( bias_voltage = 0 . 0 v ) system b ( bias_voltage = 0 . 0 v ) - 2 0 gate_voltage ( v ) 2 4 figure 7 : the variation of quantum conductance , g , of the systems a and b with the gate_voltage , vg 170 have_been presented as figure 6 . applying a bias_voltage , vb , on the electrodes shifting transmission values corresponding to the fermi_energy according_to the following equation obtained by san - huang et_al .
