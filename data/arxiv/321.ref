UNK 8 geoffroy_horel homotopy_invariance of operadic coend . we_want to study the homotopy_invariance of coends of the form p ⊗ m a for a an m - algebra and p a right module over m . the following definition is due_to muro ( see [ mur13 ] ) . 2 . 11 . definition . let ( c , ⊗ , i ) be a symmetric_monoidal model category . we say that an object x of c is pseudo - cofibrant if tensoring with x preserves_cofibrations and trivial_cofibrations . 2 . 12 . proposition . we have : • cofibrant_objects are pseudo - cofibrant . • the unit i is pseudo - cofibrant . • a tensor_product of pseudo - cofibrant_objects is pseudo - cofibrant . • if c is a simplicial symmetric_monoidal model category , objects of the form k ⊗ i , where k is any simplicial_set , are pseudo - cofibrant . • if x → y is a cofibration and x is pseudo - cofibrant , then y is pseudo - cofibrant . proof . only the last claim is not_entirely trivial . it_follows easily from an application of the pushout_product_axiom ( see [ mur13 ] for aBRhermes lavoisier ( 2003 ) 26 – 40 .

( 31 ) to calculate the ion dynamics when a small alternating current voltage is applied . the main_advantage compared to the brute_force_approach of sec . iii b 1 , where the problem is solved directly by considering the exact eq . ( 7 ) , is the reduction of computation time by several_orders of magnitudes . however , the different approaches offer the possibility to avoidBRsi / sd treatment , one would conclude_that these operators appear in a complicated way in the sd response , entwined with o4 , o6 , o7 , o9 , o10 , o13 , and o14 and suppressed by v2 t , when in fact they make the leading contributions to a new type of scalar response . in principle all three couplings could_be determined from the nuclear_recoil distribution , as o3 , o12 , and o15 appear in rl with distinct leading - order behaviors in q2 / m2 n . these few_examples show that many more tools become_available for constraining the effective theory ’_s lecs once the new response functions associated_with nuclear compositeness are recognized . velocity - dependent interactions that appear to be difficult to probe in the standard si / sd formalism can_be isolated and studied in these new response functions , where they play enhanced roles . 5 . implications for experiments in the previous_section we have noted that the larger number of responses that are revealed when the nuclear finite size is properly treated opens_up lots of additional opportunities for constraining the parameters of the effective theory , and thus for restricting the form of candidate ultraviolet theories that map onto the eft . conversely , if one limits consideration to the standard si / sd description of the scattering , one can_be mislead . for example , conflicts may appear to arise between experiments because the analysis framework is too_restrictive , when in fact no conflict exists . one illustration in given in fig . 2 , where the spin response function used in standard si / sd responses is compared to the transverse magnetic ( orbital_angular_momentum
