[ 12 ] . to ensure_consistency and better compatibility of the obtained results and drawn afterwards conclusions , two independent computational runs were_made , using both the generalized_gradient_approximation ( gga ) with the perdew - burkeernzerhof functional [ 45 ] and local density approximation ( lda ) with the ceperley - alderperdew - zunger ( ca - pz ) functional [ 46 , 47 ] . since no defects have_been_considered , theBRbehaves_as √ χ ( z ) = 63 / 4 λ z , ( 7 ) 3 which removes one of the independent parameters of the model in [ 7 ] . using the phenomenological value of λ , which determines the slope of the radial regge_trajectories , we find a mass_splitting that is much_too_large . because this problem arises in the equation that is independent of the potential , this issue cannot_be resolved by the choice of potential in models that do_not consider the glueball condensate . models that derive the field behavior using the superpotential method suffer_from the same problem . to resolve this problem , we consider the effects of the glueball condensate g on the background equations . this field must_be linear in the ir for linear confinement , and behave_as g ∼ z4 in the uv to match the operator dimension in the ads_/_cft_dictionary . it is noted that the model proposed by huang and li [ 18 , 19 ] accurately represents the nonrestoration of chiral_symmetry using a model with only two background fields , but their model differs_from the work_presented_here in several_respects . they place the meson_fields and chiral dynamics in the open - string sector of the model . for linear confinement , this requires that the chiral field approach a constant in the ir , which necessitates a modified metric to obtain the correct chiral dynamics . our model allows the metric to remain purely ads in the string_frame . finally , they_do_not determine an_explicit form of the potential , which is the central goal of this_work . iii . construction of potential consider the action in the einstein_frame ( 4 ) . to simplify the equations of motion , we useBR. 1 ) . thus , the absorption of graphene_monolayer with an rmbf can_be enhanced by about 3 . 3 times . for three graphene_monolayers , a maximum thz absorbance of 0 . 85 can_be achieved ( dash - dot - dotted_line in fig . 1 ) . similar to graphene with a 1dpc , the graphene_layer and the metal_film act as the mirrors of the fabry - perot_cavity . the thz wave_propagates back and forth_between these two mirrors , which leads to photon localization and enhances the absorption of graphene [ 41 , 47 ] . in fig . 1 , we also show the thz absorption of graphene_layers prepared on top of 7 . 5 period alternating si and 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 e c n a b r o s b a 0 . 0 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 graphene sio UNK p - si silver_film 2 1 . 0 1 . 2 frequency ( thz ) 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 . 0 ( color_online ) the absorbance of graphene as a fig . 1 : function of the frequency for different structures : suspended_graphene monolayer ( black_solid_line ) , graphene_monolayer with a 1dpc ( green_dotted_line ) , graphene_monolayer with an rmbf ( red_dashed_line ) , two graphene_monolayers with an rmbf ( blue_dash - dotted_line ) , and three graphene_monolayers ( dark_yellow dash - dot - dotted_line ) . the inset_shows the schematic of the graphene_layer prepared on top of sio2 / p - si spacer_layers with an rmbf . sio2 layersBRfold energy degeneracy ( 3 - dp ) at the γ point ; UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK form a double band and have a two - fold_degeneracy point ( 2 - dp ) at the γ point . the triple band and the double band are separated by an energy interval of ∆ . if in one spin channel the d - orbital filling number n UNK is 2 , the two low - lying bands UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK are filled and the fermi_level crosses the gap_between UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK ( fig . 3a ) . consequently , non - conducting . if n UNK UNK 3 , the added electron fills one of the triple bands ( UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK ) ; then the fermi_level cuts through the triple band ( fig . 3b ) . the three bands join together at the γ point , hence this spin channel is metallic . a similar analysis is applicable to the situation of n UNK UNK 4 ( fig . 3c ) . however , when n UNK UNK 5 conclude_that for intermediate interaction the spin channel is metallic if n UNK UNK 1 , 3 , 4 and semiconducting if n UNK UNK 2 , 5 . the inherent gap of the carbon skeleton is exposed and the spin channel is ( fig . 3d ) , the inherent gap of the carbon skeleton is exposed again . we may therefore   figure 3 . schematic_picture of band_structures of tm - carbon systems ,BRe . g . , [ 48 ] ) , and in the analysis of chaotic scattering in few - channel systems [ 49 ] . such variables are used to characterize the effective width of narrow distributions possessing moments of arbitrary order [ 50 , 51 ] . in fig . 3 ( b ) , we present_numerical_results for p ( d ) for different values of l and h = 1 / 3 , for the translationally_invariant case . we observe an interesting_phenomenon of a change in the form of the distribution as l is increased . for relatively_small l , the distribution is bell - shaped and centered_at d = 1 / 2 . however , on increasing l , p ( d ) broadens , becomes almost_flat at a certain critical l ( whose value depends_on h ) , and then changes its shape so that d = 1 / 2 minimizes the distribution . this implies that for sufficiently_large l , two values of the diffusion_coefficients obtained for two different_realizations of v ( x ) are most_likely very_different , and the event dl = d ′ l is the least probable . note_that a similar dependence in the distribution of the prefactor in the sinai law on the strength of disorder was_recently observed in [ 52 ] . gs is supported_by the anr_grant 2011 - bs04 - 013 - 01 walkmat . this project is partially_supported_by the indo - french centre for the promotion of advanced_research under project 4604 - 3 . sg , ar and gs thank the galileo_galilei_institute for theoretical_physics , florence , italy for the hospitality and the infn for partial_support during the completion of this_work .
