( 5 ) , however 2 is strongly_correlated to the initial geometric deformation but not to dilepton azimuthal_angles with the fluctuating initial_condition . event plane azimuthal_angle j n ( m ) for dileptons , to support the above reasoning , we introduce the following j n ( m ) = 1 n arctan hpt sin ( nf ) i hpt cos ( nf ) i .
