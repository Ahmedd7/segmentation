agreement_with the periodic side boundary_conditions . after the magnetic_field was_introduced into the domain , we let the simulated photosphere evolve for approximately 1 . 5 hours . during the first few_minutes of the simulation , large parts of the magnetic_field were advected into the intergranular_lanes , while some magnetic_flux was cancelled due_to the opposite - polarity initial_configuration ( see , e . g . , cameron et_al . 2007 ) . magnetic_field concentrations of opposite_polarity with unsigned strength of up to 1 . 6 kg at the continuum formation level were subsequently formed . since the turbulent magneto - convection process is effectively random , these intergranular opposite - polarity magnetic_field concentrations move , and sometimes come_closer together , reconnect and cancel_out . one typical example of such an event was selected for further_investigation . snapshots from our_simulations are shown in fig . 2 .BRa post - processing recovery operation : either i or x . the fidelities of the decoded qubits vary with the encoded state . for the cases where no recovery operation was needed the fidelities are within the values [ 0 . 810 ± 0 . 036 , 0 . 990 ± 0 . 009 ] . decoded qubits , in which a x recovery operarecoveryabcde tion was applied , present slightly_lower fidelities , [ 0 . 629 ± 0 . 039 , 0 . 982 ± 0 . 008 ] . this discrepancy follows_from nonideal resource states as shown in fig . 2b . due_to experimental noise , the single - qubit fidelities of qubit 4 vary for different projections of qubit 2 and qubit 3 . to illustrate some of the experimental_results , in fig . 4 we show the results obtained for the case where the state n UNK = ( + i UNK + e − i π 2 ) was encoded ( fig . 4 ) , subjected_to a full phase error on qubit 3 , and subsequently decoded . 2 ( here , ± i UNK = ( 0 UNK ± i1 UNK ) / √ 4 − i UNK ) / √ a list of the fidelities of all operations performed is shown in the appendix , where we also show the results for errors occurring on qubit 2 . iv . conclusion we have presented the implementation of an error - detection protocol in measurement - based quantum_computing . although the demonstration was_performed using a photonic quantum_computing architecture , measurement - based error detection and correction can_be implemented with other physical_systems as demonstrated recently with trapped_ionsBRas expected , their variance when one studies local dynamics is larger . this observation strengthens our hypothesis that fullerenes act as nanoscopic grinders dispersed in the polymeric matrix , yielding strong deviation of polymer local dynamics from the bulk in their close neighborhood . fullerene rotational diffusivity the fact that the fullerenes are geometrically rigid on an atomistic scale ( although clearly vibrating ) and essentially spherical enables their rotational_motion to be readily characterized using a single rotational_diffusion measure . if e is any arbitrary unit_vector embedded in the cluster and passing_through its center , then the orientational_correlation function ce ( t ) = UNK ei ( t ) ei ( 0 ) UNK can_be computed . the simplest approach to define e is to use the separation vector between each fullerene ’_s center of mass and a specific predefined atom . figure 12 . fullerenes ’ rotational autocorrelation_function . we consider a vector connecting a fullerene ’_s center of mass with a predefined atom . the main figure refers_to 400 k , while the inset to the figure refers_to 480 k . the results for two temperatures ( which were considered for the local msd calculation ) , are presented in figure 12 . the main plot contains the results for the temperature of 400 k , whileBR25 ] for the other cuprate systems , la2 − xsrxcuo4 and bi2sr2cacu2o8 + δ . on the other_hand , neither thz nor microwave measurements detected the temperature scale t p . this might_be due_to the ambiguity in determining the normal carrier component which we need to subtract in the analysis to calculate ω 2 ps from σ 2 ( ω ) [ 26 ] . our t p values are in good_agreement_with the temperatures observed by ellipsometry [ 6 ] and partly by nernst_effect [ 27 , 28 ] . in ref . 6 , t p was estimated only from the phonon_softening related to the tjp resonanceBRg . , heinz et_al . 2006 ;

second , with two regions with different densities / temperatures in pressure_balance . the first model investigates if turbulent_heating can balance radiative_losses in the core and the second one focuses_on turbulent_mixing of gases at dissimilar temperatures ( kim &_narayan 2003 ; voigt &_fabian 2004 ; dennis &_chandran 2005 have considered phenomenological_models of turbulent_mixing in past ) . we require almost sonic velocities forBRg such that there_exists y ∈ o and ϕ as in equation 3 , such that the space of degenerate_whittaker_forms for π associated to ( y , ϕ ) is non - zero . as g1 / g1 ∩ y # is a symplectic vector_space and l / ly is self dual , it_follows that lh : = ( l ∩ g1 ) / ( l ∩ g1 ∩ y # ) is a self dual lattice in the symplectic vector_space h / z ( h ) UNK g1 / ( g1 ∩ y # ) . recall the definition of the heisenberg_group h ( see equation 4 ) and as ψ is trivial on oe , it_follows that one can extend the character ψ of e UNK z ( h ) to a character of the inverse_image of 2lh under h − → g1 / ( g1 ∩ y # ) by defining it to be trivial on 2lh × { 0 } ⊂ h . from lemma 4 in [ 8 ] , thisBR( 3 ) the intersection of any two concave stars contains the intersection of their_respective center cells ( which has codimension 1 in each cell ) , ( 4 ) the flat_ridges of facets in concave regions of s ( i , j ) are only found in the intersection with other ( 5 ) the flat_ridges of s ( i , j ) found in the intersection of concave regions are part of a coherent set for concave regions , j UNK = 0 , and ( 6 ) the flat_ridges of s ( i , 0 ) are coherent .
