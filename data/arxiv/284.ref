( p . 183 ) here we will_discuss the application of the chi influence method to the assessment of u . s researchdoctorate programs because of the possibility of gauging its relevance to human_judgment . in a key paper foreshadowing the basic_concept underlying pagerank , pinski and narin ( 1976 ) set forth the basic_idea_behind the journal influence method that a citation from a highly prestigious journal should_be given more weight than a citation from a less influential and obscure journal . they introduced the chi method by first critiquing previously used measures of influence . according_to them , total_number of publications is only a measure of total activity , whereas total cites to a set of publications , while incorporating a measure of peer recognition , was size dependent with no meaning on the absolute scale . most_interesting and significant was their criticism of garfield ’_s impact_factor , which , they noted , was size independent as the ratio of the number of citations the journal receives to the number of publications in a specified earlier time period but also has no meaning on the absolute scale . pinski and narin ( 1976 ) then listed three additional limitations of the impact_factor , which they began thus : … although the size of the journal , as reflected in the number of publications , is corrected for , the average length ofBRt n a n m o d i 31 15 7 4 0 . 1 0 − 500 − 400 100 − 300 − 200 30 − 200 − 180 − 160 − 140 − 120 − 100 − 80 200 20 − 120 − 110 − 100 − 90 − 80 − 70 − 60 − 50 − 40 300 20 − 80 − 70 − 60 − 50 400 − 40 − 30 20 − 60 − 55 − 50 − 45 − 40 − 35 − 30 − 25 − 20 500 fig . 5 : the phase_diagram of oscillations , the dominant frequency of population rate of the network according_to fft . colors are associated to brain waves :
