omori response without further fitting_parameters . our success is partly_due_to the fact that we are able_to identify the omori processes within a context for which non - stationarity is well_established [ 5 ] and amenable to modeling [ 3 , 4 ] . in an interday context , the question of the applicability of the models of ref . [ 2 ] to omori regimes has_already_been raised in ref . [ 6 ] . this note is organized_as_follows . in the next_section we_briefly_recall the model of refs . [ 3 , 4 ] and present the procedure of calibration . in the third section we discuss theBR. the map b ( α ) ← m ( α ) is an_isomorphism . indeed , b α , n is a subobject both of b α , n + 1 and a α + 1 , n + 1 hence , by ( e ) , of their intersection m α , n + 1 . the inclusions b α , n → m α , n + 1 induce the map b ( α ) → m ( α ) inverse to b ( α ) ← m ( α ) . each connecting map m ( α ) → b ( α + 1 ) = colim n b α + 1 , n = colim n a α + 1 , n is in the image of f by ( c ) . for all limit_ordinals β < cf kxk , colim α < β b ( α ) is isomorphic to b ( β ) by ( f ) . lemma 2 . 4 applies now to show that colim α < cf kxk b ( α ) is in the image of f . but that colimit is isomorphic to x , since it is a subobject of x and ( a ) holds . UNK let_us construct the diagram now . to define the bottom_row , we resume the notation of prop . 2 . 2 . since card ( fp set c ) < kxk , one has card ( u ( x ) ) = kxk . write u ( x ) as the union of a smooth chain of subsets s α , α < cf kxk , with cardBR, in supergravity ed . p . van_nieuwenhuizen and d . z . freedman ( north_holland , amsterdam ) 315 ( 1979 ) . r . n . mohapatra and g . senjanovic , phys . rev . lett . 44 912 ( 1980 ) [ 13 ] e . witten , phys . lett . b91 81 ( 1980 ) [ 14 ] m . nemeevsek , g . senjanovic and v . tello , phys . rev . lett . 110 151802 ( 2013 ) [ 15 ] s . f . king and c . luhn , rept . prog . phys . 76 , 056201 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv_: 1301 . 1340 [_hep - ph ] ] .

( 1997 ) in the context of rwm ) are satisfied . additionally , if some of the regularity_conditions are violated , for example , if the support of the target density is boundedBRweakly_interacting molecules at metal_surfaces . we have established that fde yields chemical accuracy when , in the ks - dft_calculation , there is no hybridization of the orbitals of the molecules with the bands of the metal . with such encouraging_results , this_work sets the stage to applying fde to a wide_array of molecular systems interacting with surfaces with applications to energy - related materials as_well as catalysis and photovoltaics . because of the inapplicability of semilocal fde to molecule – surface interactions beyond weak physisorption , we also conclude_that non - locality in the energy functionals ( both at the kinetic and the exchange – correlation level ) must_be included if fde aspires to become a true alternative to kohn – sham_dft . efforts in this directions have_been taken in our lab regarding the exchange – correlation [ 55 ] , and ongoing_efforts are placed in the search for computationally amenable ways to include non - locality at the kinetic_energy level as_well . 6 acknowledgements we thank_dr . oliviero andreussi for stimulating_discussions . we acknowledge startup_funds provided by rutgers_university – newark , for support of this research . 7 appendix 7 . 1 recast of the effective_potential expression due_to the fact that in molecular codes employing localized orbital basis sets the computation of two - electron integrals can_be expensive ( gaussian basis ) , or only possible through density fitting (
