of low - flux sources from lower_redshifts that may obscure the eor objects of interest , as suggested in ref . [ 83 ] . the very_faint eor sources , in this case , will be easiest identified in the cleanest field on the sky . again , an adaptive survey strategy to identify the cleanest of several candidate patches may well be warranted . in this regard , one should_be mindful of an inherent difference_between the application of adaptive survey strategies to stochastic measurements and deep - field imaging . while a choice of an optimal sky patch for deep - field imaging may considerably_improve the sensitivity of a given experiment , the initial stage of exploration is mostly wasted . therefore , the figure - of - merit when_comparing different strategies should_be the speed of convergence onto the optimal_arm instead of the total regret , and the best - performing algorithms may be different . nevertheless , an initial stage of exploration may still prove invaluable in reducing the error in the integrated signal from the chosen patch to image . a somewhat_different version of the mab_problem in the context of astronomical_observations shows up in the case of follow - up observations of transients [ 41 ] , for example . in this case , the exploration versus exploitation_tradeoff is manifested in the challenge of allocat3 very_recently , the performance of two non - adaptive modes of observation for the murchinson widefield_array [ 72 ] — corresponding to the greedy and  - greedy with  = 1 methods described_above — was_investigated in detail [ 73 ] . ing the wide_array of resources to theBRcertainly any statement such as ( 5 ) will not hold for such a general r ( when ordered by height ) . 3 . 2 . fields of rationality . in this section we introduce a construction of families via field of rationality . let π be an_automorphic_representation of gln ( a ) . the field of rationality q ( π ) for π is by definition the fixed field in c under { σ ∈ aut ( c ) : π σ ≃ π } where π σ : = π ⊗ c , σ c . a well_knownBRconverges at finite values , as expected . on the other_hand , in weakly_correlated regimes ( u < uc for ψ sc and ψ n ; u . 3t for ψ af ) , λ n does_not_diverge as l →_∞ , but has scattered values around 0 . 6 irrespective of the system size , as found in fig . 1 ( b ) . an origin of this result probably lies in the statistical_errors in vmc sampling . the expectation_values of zn for these correlation strengths are extremely_close to zero but positive finite . therefore , if the numerical error ǫ exceeds the correct expectation_value , the estimation by vmc yields an_arbitrary value of order ǫ as zn . to verify this possibility , we carry_out a series of vmc_calculations for ψ sc by widely varing the sampling number m for a fixed l ( = 12 ) ; the statistical_errors are proportional to 1 / √ m . the results are plotted in fig . 2 ( a ) . we find that the value of λ n steadily_increases as m increases , although the increments are small because λ n is a logarithmic function of zn [ eq . ( 5 ) ] . thus , in order to estimate λ n accurately for a system with large λ n , it is necessary to precisely determine zn of a large negative power . in this connection , we calculate λ n for less - than - half - filled or doped systems , which are metallic for any value of u / t , with the same sample number as in fig . 1 ( b ) .BRheat of formation δ hf ( ev ) band_gap ( ev ) vb width ( ev ) table i . structural_parameters , heat of formation , minimum band_gaps and valence_band widths of rutile_tio2 from gga - pbe , the sx method and experiment [ 32 , 51 , 52 ] . experiment 4 . 59 0 . 644 - 9 . 74 3 . 05 6 sx 4 . 56 0 . 648 0 . 305 - 9 . 73 3 . 1 6 . 27 b . oxygen_vacancy 0 , vo + and vo we first consider the oxygen_vacancy ( vo ) . fig . 4 shows the plane view of ion - ion spacings around the ideal vacancy . removing one oxygen_atom from tio2 results in two unpaired_electrons and three ti dangling_bonds . the ideal spacings_between adjacent ti atoms are two at 3 . 55 å and one along the c axis 2 + for the neutral , singly_charged and doubly_charged states at 2 . 99 å . we denote vo 0 , after relaxation the adjacent ti atoms move_outwards , so respectively for the oxygen_vacancy . for vo + , the the ti - ti distance increases to 3 . 7 å , and 3 . 04 å along the c axis . for the singly positive vacancy vo 2 + the positive charge causes a greater repulsion for a ti - ti distance to 3 . 85 å and 3 . 12 å along oz . for vo ti - ti distance increases to 3 . 94 å and 3 . 22 å along oz . in other_words , the lattice relaxation is 4 . 2 % for 2 + . aBRextra - terrestrial neutrino all along the 30 - tev - pev energy , leaving a marginal atmospheric ν role ; such transition should_be ruling more and more ( 1 over ten ) on atmospheric ones , suggesting that the dominance occurs already at earlier energies , around 10 tev , as suggested in our articles ; otherwise , as the new proposal and the connected question marked in the title , a sudden flavor change at 30 - 60 tev seem unexplained : p ( k = 8 , n = 11 ) = 7 . 45 · 10 − 3 assuming a ratio 1 / 3 for nc over a complete cc rate for most neutrino ; assuming a more_realistically probability p = 1 10 for nc ( at given energy ) over p = 9 10 for cc interactions by atmospheric_muon neutrino [ 11 ] , the probability to occur is almost vanishing : p ( k = 8 , n = 11 ) = 1 . 2 ∗ 10 − 6 : there is no room for an atmospheric hidden role in a 30 − 60 tev energy band . otherwise the puzzle is even greater . 4 . conclusions : extraterrestrial neutrino at tens tev i = 1 u2 matrix discussed in recent_articles [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] p α β = UNK 3 extraterrestrial_neutrinos ( by agn , grbs by jets or by uhecr via gzk cut_off or their decay in flight , by prompt charmed interaction and decoherenceBR2 kpc , the green_contours ( top_right ) to 4 . 5 kpc . the crosses_indicate the corresponding χ 2 - minima . the shaded_areas in the top_left and bottom_right of the plot indicate the regions excluded by the requirements of causality and from the fastest rotation - powered_pulsar known so_far , psr j1748 − 2446ad ( 716 hz ) . nh / ( 1022 atoms cm − 2 ) teff / ( 106 k ) m r5 χ 2 red / d . o . f . p - value 1 . 95 + 0 . 06 − 0 . 07 2 . 2 + 1 . 2 − 0 . 2 1 . 5 + 0 . 4 − 0 . 6 12 . 6 + 2 . 1 − 5 . 3 0 . 98 / 408 0 . 59 1 . 95 + 0 . 05 − 0 . 07 2 . 4 + 0 . 9 − 0 . 4 2 . 2 + 0 . 3 − 0 . 9 15 . 6 + 3 . 6 − 5 . 3 0 . 98 / 408 0 . 59 1 + z = [ 1 − m ( 0 . 337r5 ) − 1 ] − 1 / 2 , ( 4 ) 5 ( 1 + z ) ]BRmarco &_negueruela 2002 ; 18 b . lim et_al . figure 13 . age distribution of the pms_stars in two different regions . the finder_chart in the lower_panel_shows the spatial_distribution of the members . the star marks denote the location of the heads of the emission_nebulae sim 129 and 130 . the region centred_on the cluster_centre ( region 1 ) and that on the vicinity of the emission_nebulae ( region 2 ) are outlined by circles . a rectangular_box ( dashed_line ) represents a region that was used to search for the age variation of pms_stars with the distance from the cluster core . the other symbols are the same as fig 3 . the reddening - corrected cmds of the pms_members in each region are plotted in the upper_panels . the solid_line ( red ) represents the 1 . 5 myr_isochrone from the pms evolutionary_models of siess_et_al .
