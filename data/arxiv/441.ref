( 103 ) ( 104 ) ( 105 ) for each such case , we evaluate the conditions in ( 103 ) – ( 105 ) , and summarize the resulting antenna configuration regimes ( with redundancies removed )BRthat induces the least perturbing effect . it is important to understand that this type of distinguishability differs in general from the distinguishability usually considered in the study of quantum_correlations , namely how well a local measurement can distinguish_between elements of a statistical_mixture of quantum states of a composite quantum system . the asymmetry in treating the subsystems in the definition eq . ( 9 ) is an intrinsic feature of this type of discord , like many other measures of quantum_correlations . if we take the analogous definition but with minimization defined under_local_unitary_transformations on both subsystems , then one_finds that the resulting measure can vanish for some states that do_not_belong_to the set of classical - quantum states . the simplest relevant example is the one of two - qubit werner_states which are invariant_under all the transformations of the form ua ⊗ ubw abu † a ⊗ u † b , with ua = ub = u . it then follows that u ⊗ uw abu † ⊗ u † = w ab . the would - be symmetric bures discord is thus always vanishing for these states and does_not define a faithful measure of quantum_correlations . b . choice of the spectrum we will now investigate in more_detailBRUNK ) . by lemma 5 . 1 , p - a . s . for n large_enough , for any x ∈ bn , there_exists a self - avoiding path , say ( x = x1 , x2 , x3 , . . . ) that reaches from x the boundary of b2n with conductances larger_than ( 2n ) − α . let then x be in a box bm ( z ) that intersects bn . by lemma 2 . 1 together_with the borel –_cantelli_lemma , m is larger_than the size of a hole . it_follows that there is some k < m such that xk ∈ c ξ . this gives_us the first part of the path UNK ( x , x UNK ) . n through a path on c ξ inside b4m ( xk ) : = xk + b4m ( note_that x , x UNK ∈ b4m ( xk ) and that d ( x UNK , ∂ b4m ( xk ) ) > m ) . indeed , if we suppose that it is not possible to find this strong path , there would_be necessarily a closed cutset ( as seen in lemma 2 . 3 ) ( of conductances less_than ξ ) of diameter at_least m separating xk from x UNK in b4m (BR1 , then c is saturated . proof : let c be a non - redundant two - layer comparator_network , and assume_that the second layer of c has at_least two unused channels ( otherwise there is nothing to prove ) . if one of these channels were unused at layer 1 , then the network would contain the pattern ( 2a ) , ( 2b ) or ( 2c ) . thus , by theorem 1 necessarily the two channels are connected at layer 1 . again from the same theorem , we_know that they must_be both min - channels or both max - channels ( otherwise case ( 1 ) applies ) and the channels they are connected to at layer 1 cannot_be connected at layer 2 , otherwise the network would_be redundant . there are eight different cases to consider . we detail the cases where the two unused channels are max channels . assume_that the four relevant channels areBRbecause of the relation_between cartesian and spherical_coordinates eab behaving_like r corresponds_to cartesian_components of the electric part of the weyl_tensor behaving_like r − 1 . now keeping_only the dominant terms in eqns .
