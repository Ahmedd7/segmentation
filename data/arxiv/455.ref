( 64 ) this condition is natural , as any nonzero trace part ∼ i would not modify the dirac_matrices and hence leave also the geometry unaffected . even if zv was not traceless , the trace part would act similar to that of the covariant_derivative discussed in theBRcombination ( cc ) of pulses from up to four main amplifier channels30 . for the experiments presented_here , the system is operated with 270 µ j pulse energy , a compressed pulse_duration of approximately 340 fs and a repetition_rate between 50 khz and 0 . 6 mhz , which corresponds_to an average power between 14 w and 163 w . the laser_pulses are sent to the nonlinear compression setup that is described in25 . they are coupled into the 1 . 1 m long hollow - core fiber with an inner_diameter of 250 µ m . after evacuation the tube is filled with 4 bar of krypton gas to enable spectral_broadening . subsequently , the pulses are compressed in time by a chirped mirror compressor with a group delay dispersion of - 1600 fs2 . after propagation through this setup the pulses are 29 fs short ( fig . 2b ) ) and have an energy of 130 µ j - 150 µ j . at the highest repetition_rate of 600 khz the average power used for high_harmonic_generation is > 80 w . high_harmonic_generation and characterization of
