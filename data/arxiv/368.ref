( 14 ) with this lagrangian , the energy_density calculated on spherically - symmetric electric_field configuration following the noether_theorem is θ 00 = e2 2 + 3 γ e4 8 . ( 15 ) the behaviour ( 13 ) provides the ultraviolet , near x = 0 , convergence of the electrostatic_field energy r θ 00d3x of the point charge . as for the convergence of this integral at x →_∞ , it is provided by the standard long - range coulomb behaviour ( 11 ) of the solution to equation ( 10 ) obtained by neglecting the second_term inside the bracket as compared to the unity in the far - off region . the explicit use of the cardan formula in ( 15 ) allows to calculate the integral for the field energy . if the value lf f = e4 45 π 2m4 , ( 16 ) where e and m are the electron charge and mass , is calculated referring to the euler - heisenberg_effective_lagrangian of qed and substituted for γ , the result for the " rest mass of the electron , " understood as a point charge , is about_twice the true electron mass : z θ 00d3x = 2 . 09m . ( 17 ) the conclusion about finiteness of the electrostatic_field energy of a point charge is readily_extended [ 5 ] to the nonlinear_electrodynamics with the effective_lagrangian being anyBR, we reduce the errors in the scattering_phase_shift over a broad_range of wavevectors . this delivers the pseudopotential shown in fig . 1 ( a ) that is smooth , leading to improved numerical_stability and efficiency . fig . 1 ( c ) demonstrates that this potential is exact at the calibration wavevector k = kf and delivers a marked decrease in phase_shift error across all wavevectors . the three potentials deliver a significant progression in accuracy . the hard_sphere potential reproduces the correct scattering behavior at k = 0 . both the soft sphere and troullier - martins potential are transferable : the former producing correct scattering around k = 0 and the latter around k ∼ kf the significant_improvement delivered by the troullier - martins potential encourages_us to develop the formalism to propose an ultratransferable pseudopotential that produces accurate phase_shifts over all of the wavevectors occupied in a fermi_gas . to develop ultransferable pseudopotentials we continue to focus_on the contact potential , though the methodology can_be readily_generalized to other interparticle_interactions . we construct a pseudopotential that is identical to the contact potential outside of a cutoff radius_rc , but inside has a continuous first derivative at both r = 0 and r = rc , v ( r ) ef rc UNK 2 UNK v1 UNK 1 = ____ UNK 1 − r 0 2 + r rc UNK + nv UNK i = 2 rc UNK i UNK r ≤ rc vi UNK r r > rc , with nv = 9
