width continually increases from 58 nm up to a maximum of 325 nm with increasing variant number . with further increase of the variant number , the variant width decreases_continuously again and remains_constant in the range of 60 nm . the maximum variant width represent the variants situated in the middle of a long laminate ( figure_4a ) . it is interesting to compare this decrease of variant width with the fractal process of coarsening . it 9 has_recently_been suggested , that the intermartensitic transition between 14m and nm proceeds in discrete steps , by doubling the variant width [ 17 ] . the continuous decrease of variant width within type y pattern suggests_that the present microstructure has a different origin than coarsening of nm martensite . the variant width in the second region of type y pattern ( figure 4d ) does_not show a clear_trend . up to the variant number of 18 , the variant width ranges between 25 nm and 200_nm . this strong fluctuation can_be caused_by the refinement of variants when_approaching the interface to a differently_oriented type y laminate ( figure 4d , lower_left_corner ) . the difference_between the minimum and maximum values decreases with increasing variant number , the variant width oscillates_around a mean_value of 53 nm . starting atBRv ( y e g m r e y n g e r e g n n e s a e r c n g n s a e r c n i i i 0 . 08 ml a 0 . 2 ml b c d e 0 . 3 ml f 0 . 4 ml g fig . 2 . bottom_panel : molecular configurations for different water coverages and their relative energies ( in mev / h2o_molecule ) . a 2x6 unit_cell was used for the lowest coverage of 0 . 08 ml ( a ) while a 2x5 unit_cell was used for the higher coverages , 0 . 2 – 0 . 4 ml ( bg ) . top_panel : diagram showing the relative energies for the different coverages ( in mev / h2o_molecule ) . the zero energy level represents the lowest - energy configuration for each of the coverages . order to find the one with the lowest_energy . this configuration was used subsequently when adding the next molecule to the surface . thus , we successively filled the surface with molecules up to full monolayer_coverage collecting on the way information_about possible structures for each of the considered coverages . this approach allowed_us_to interpret the basic mechanisms_behind the water layer formation and the structure of the resulting monolayer . the most_important results of this investigation are_summarized in figures 2 and 3 . in the low coverage limit ( 0 . 08 mlBR( 42 ) ( 43 ) by bloch law , there is ψ a = a1eikax + a2e − ikax ( 0 < x < a ) , ψ b = b1eikb x + b2e − ikb x ( a < x < a + b ) . ψ ( a + b < x < 2a + b ) = ψ ( 0 < x < a ) eik ( a + b ) = ( a1eika ( x − ( a + b ) ) + a2e − ika ( x − ( a + b ) ) ) eik ( a + b ) , where k is bloch_wave_vector . at x = a , by the continuation of wave_function andBRp + . the right_hand_side is a positive_definite_matrix since it is the hessian of the convex function s ( p k q ) . thus the s satisfying ( 5 ) is convex and corresponds_to a strictly_proper_scoring_rule . this solution is unique_up to equivalence since the solution of a second - order_differential_equation is unique_up to a linear term . ( 5 ) 4 having shown that a compatible proper_scoring_rule always_exists , we now provide an_alternative characterization for compatibility which has direct applications to optimal score estimation and decision theory . lemma 1 . a weighted scoring family s ( p , r k · ) is compatible_with the proper_scoring_rule sBRp ω that is lipschitz_continuous on ∂ sp ω with_respect_to the mazurkiewicz metric dm is resolutive , and any bounded perturbation of such a function on ∂ p ω \ ∂ sp ω yields a resolutive function whose perron solution agrees_with the perron solution of the original function . this phenomenon is illustrated by the following two examples . example 8 . 2 . this example considers the so - called double comb : ω : = ( 0 , 1 ) × ( 0 , 1 ) \ [ 1 < n ∈ n { 1 / ( 2n ) } × [ 0 , 1 − 1 / n ] ∪_{ 1 / ( 2n + 1 ) } × [ 1 / n , 1 ] . this again is a simply_connected planar domain , but now the set e : = { 0 } × [ 0 , 1 ] is the impression of a single prime end . note_that ∂ p ω is compact in this example , but ∂ sp ω is not . it is again easyBRUNK UNK UNK 1 + log 1 + α y k α y k . the following two propositions , whose proof is relagated to the appendix , ensure that assumptions 6 . 1 ( ii ) and 6 . 1 ( iii ) are satisfied proposition 6 . 1 there_exists a constant c ∗ , independent of s , τ and α so that for all ( ν , β ) ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] × [ 1 / 2 , 1 ] : s UNK UNK vbs , α ss ( t , s ) UNK UNK ≤ c ∗ τ 1 − β α 2 β − 1 , s2 σ 2 4 UNK ( v ( 1 ) , α ss ( t , s ) ) 2 ≤ c ∗ τ 1 − ν α 2 + 2 ν . 10 vbs , α ( t , s ) = vbs ( t , s ) + α 2 e − 1 2 d0 ( s , k , τ ) 2 √ 2 π τ 2k σ φ ( v ) v2dv + o ( α 4 ) , v ( 1 ) , α ( t , s ) = v ( 1 )BRworking at the level of superconformal_field_theory , we can consider automorphisms of the full superconformal_field_theory ( 2 . 8 ) which preserve spacetime_supersymmetry . these transformations certainly include such symmetries of the k3 component of our superconformal_field_theory as were_analyzed in [ 22 ] . the full – 19 – extension of this classification to the superconformal_field_theories considered_here is a very_interesting problem that we hope to return to in the future . 5 discussion and conclusions as mentioned in the introduction , our_goal in this_paper was to find a bps state counting problem in string_theory that leads to the mock_modular_form h ( 2 ) ( τ ) ( or its modular completion ) and we suggested that the required construction would remove the massless string states from the spectrum . the two ns5 - brane system on k3 × s1 achieves what we_want in a natural manner , but the connection to our earlier discussion may not be completely clear so here we make some further_remarks on out interpretation of the calculation performed in this_paper . the k3 elliptic_genus can_be written in terms of jacobi_forms as ( see e . g [ 58 ] or eqn .
