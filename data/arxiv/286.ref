( 2012 ) . once a model galaxy has_been constructed we “ observe ” it along multiple edge - on sight_lines . each point along a sight line is assigned a weight based_on its surface_brightness and optical_depth . these weights are then used , in conjunction_with the tangential_velocity of each point , to construct an apparent line - of - sight_velocity_distribution function ( losvdf ) . we then place emitters at each point and given them a characteristic line_width of 17 km / s . the final line_profile is computed by summing the contributions of all the emitters ( weighted by the apparent losvdf ) and simulating the effects of the instrument setup used to take data of ic 2531 ( salt / rss ) . we constructed models for three different galaxy_morphologies : a smooth , doublyexponential disk , a smooth disk with a flare , and a disk with spiral_arms . 3 . results figure 1 shows an example of how different disk morphologies affect the shape of emission_line_profiles . in particular , in a smooth , doubly - exponential disk model the skew of a line_profile changes_sign ( from positive to negative ) as height is increased while a flared_disk model produces profiles with negative skew at all heights . this is due_to a redistribution of dust by the flare that allows sight - lines to penetrate farther into the galaxy at low heights . figure 2 shows example [_oiii ] 5007_emission lines from ic 2531 .BRinfinity as j goes to infinity . example 3 . 6 ( example 9 . 1 in [ 18 ] ) . let m j be the j - fold_covering space of ( 3 . 6 ) where ( s 2 , gs 2 ) is the 2 - dimensional_unit_sphere , s 2 , with the stardand metric . the metric of m j is the lifting of the metric of n j and p + , p − are opposite poles . then diam ( m j ) ≤ 4 π , vol ( ∂ m j ) ≤ 4 π and h ∂ m j →_∞ . no subsequence of m j converges in swif sense , so h ∂ m j < h for all j is necessary in theorem 1 . 4 . example 3 . 7 . let s k be the k - dimensional_unit_sphere and [ 0 , j ] ⊂ r a closed interval with standard metrics . we endow s k × [ 0 , j ] with the product metric and define ( 3 . 7 ) where we identify antipodal_points of s k × { j } . thus , ∂ m j = s k ×BRthe subject of several_studies over_three_decades . in 1983 , reynhardt and hoon8 found three - fold reorientations of the bh3 and nh3 groups with a tunneling frequency of 1 . 4 mhz in the orthorhombic_phase . penner et_al . 9 found in 1999 that these groups reoriented independently . deciphering the behavior in the tetragonal_structure has_been less_straightforward . in the same 1983 study , reynhardt and hoon concluded_that the bh3 , and possibly the nh3 groups , rotate_freely . brown et_al . 11 found that they could describe the disorder entirely with three - fold jump_diffusion . bowden et_al . tried using a larger unit_cell to model the same disorder as spatial_variation rather_than higher - order rotation ; however , they found no_evidence to support this model , 12 leaving this disagreement unrefig . 1 . structure of the high - temperature , body - centered_tetragonal phase of nh3bh3 . note_that the locations of h atoms in this figure are not indicative of experimental_results , but just one possibility of how the halos could_be oriented in the solid . solved in the literature . the present_study aims to elucidate_how the hydrogen halos behave in the solid , especially in the high - temperature , tetragonal_structure . to this end , we find thermal barriers to rotation in gas_phase as_well as both orthorhombic and tetragonal_phases . we supplement these_findings with ab_initio_molecular_dynamics_simulations to track individual halos ’ behavior . our ab_initio_simulations are at theBRformed by the ends of that path ) . hence we may_assume that there are nodes in g \ π .

shaped for κ = 5 . now , we analyze the theoretical data using the uniform , and the poisson distributions for κ = 1 , 5 , 10 . we find that any of these distributions in conjunction_with any of the three measures , viz . the mean deviation , the standard_deviation , or the bhattacharya distance , when applied to theoretical data for mz or cxx in the infinite quantum xy model , detects the qpt point . however , the signatures of qpt , obtained by usingBRfh0 . this fact was_proved before by azad - van_den ban - biswas [ 2 ] using a different approach . here we exploit more decisively the associated vector_bundle construction obtained by ph0 - representations by viewing g → fh0 = g / ph0 as a ph0 - principal_bundle ( see subsection 2 . 1 ) . the isomorphism ad ( g ) h0 ≈ t ∗ fh0 provides the adjoint_orbit with two different actions , namely the natural transitive_action on ad ( g ) h0 and the linear action on t ∗ fh0 obtained by lifting the action of g on fh0 . the later action is not transitive since the zero section is invariant . thus one is asked to build a transitive_action on the cotangent_bundle t ∗ fh0 different from the linear action . we do_so by constructing a lie_algebra θ ( g ) of hamiltonian_vector_fields ( with_respect_to the canonical_symplectic_form ω of t ∗ f θ ) which is isomorphic to g . the elements of θ ( g ) are complete vector_fields and hence the infinitesimal_action given by θ ( g ) integrates to an action of a lie_group , by a classical theorem of palais [ 8 ] . this action is transitive and hamiltonian by construction . the isotropy_subgroup of the transitive_action is zh0 and thus t ∗ fh0 gets identified with g / zh0 . it_turns_out_that the moment_map µ : t ∗ fh0 → g of the hamiltonian action takes_values in ad ( g ) h0 and is the inverse of the previously defined map ad ( g ) h0 → t ∗ fh0 . 0 where fh ∗ in another realization of g / zh0 , it is compactified toBRand only if they are strongly dualizable . given gsc , consider ln . the gsc would_imply that the lnacyclics are loc ( he ( n ) i ∩ f ) . as observed earlier , this is the same as loc ( f ( n + 1 ) ) , which are the lf UNK n - acyclics . therefore we would have lf n ∼ = ln . the sdgsc is new , and we will_discuss it first . as mentioned in the above proof , in s compactness is equivalent to strong dualizability . it is well_known that localization away_from a set of compact_objects is smashing . the gsc is precisely the statement that the converse_holds . however , as we will show next , one only needs strong dualizability to generate a smashing_localization functor . we will state our result in slightly_more_general terms . theorem 3 . 5 . let t be a well generated tensor_triangulated_category such that loc ( 1 ) = t , as in definition 2 . 1 . let a = { b α } be a ( possibly_infinite ) set of strongly dualizable_objects . then there_exists a smashing_localization functor l : t → t with ker l = loc ( a ) . proof . let e = ∨ α b α and note_that loc ( e ) = loc ( a ) . the category t is well generated_by hypothesis . the localizing_subcategory s = loc ( e ) is also well generated ,BRlimitation , nous_avons d é but é en 2013 dans_le_cadre du_projet isart le_d_é_veloppement d ’ un simulateur multi -

scale road_networks , it can_be interesting to integrate different representations , e . g . , micro and macro , in a single model as shown on fig . 1 . some existing hybrid micro - macro traffic models are shown
