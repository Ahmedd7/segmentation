( 36 ) as we will_discuss later , interesting staircase patterns for several non - equilibrium thermodynamic_quantities can also be found for this model . another observation made in [ 80 ] is that the size of the intermediate plateaux that the function ceff ( r ) develops at the values ( 36 ) is determined_by the value of θ 0 . for θ 0 = 0 there is a single plateau at c = 1 , thus the usual sinh - gordon behaviour is recovered , whereas the plateaux at ( 36 ) become_more_prominent as θ 0 is increased . in the limit θ 0 →_∞ a single plateau at c = 1 remains which reflects the fact that the s - matrix ( 31 ) becomesBRpolynomial time o ( n3o4 ) by adding UNK y ∗ i UNK extra cache for agent i . proof : the proof simply follows_from the discussion_preceding the theorem . since the maximum cache_size for each agent is o , using theorem 5 we_get c ≤ no , and hence , t ≤ ( no ) 3 min_{ d , o − 1 } ≤ n3o4 . as a particular result of theorem 6 , we note_that for the uncapacitated selfish replication game when there is no restriction on the capacity of the agents , i . e . agents are allowed to store all finite number of available_resources in their caches , the least best_response dynamics converges to an equilibrium in polynomial time . a . a numerical example in the following , we provide some numerical_results of locating effective nodes in the network and adding_extra capacities such that the least best_response dynamics have faster_convergence to an equilibrium . in table i we show four different networks g1 , g2 , g3 and g4 in an increasing order of edge density . we consider the csr_game on these networks with o = 5 . in order to accelerate_convergence to an equilibrium in each ofBRthe ability to perform complex mathematical_analysis and computations in his head without the benefit of pencil and paper . his enormous power of memorization was paired with a rare power of concentration ⎯_ noise and hustle in his immediate_vicinity rarely disturbed him in his mental work . 68 these traits proved to be crucial for accomplishing his brilliant scholarly work later in life after he lost his sight in both eyes . he developed a new method of reducing the motions of the planets in the form of astronomical tables . already blind , euler worked_out his second lunar theory and published it in book form as theoria motuum lunae , 69 astronomer george william hill used euler_’ s theory to develop his theory of jupiter and saturn . 70 euler continued refining his lunar theory with the objective of carrying it to a higher level of perfection . 71 in 1862 , euler_’ s opera postuma contained three more essays where he amended the lunar tables using observations of a lunar_eclipse . by 1771 , after complications from an operation to remove a cataract in his good eye , euler was completely blindBRcontributions to edms : diagrams with h 0 γ γ and h 0z γ 21 the corresponding barr - zee type edms for light fermions are obtained with operators hif f or hif f from the upper ( shaded ) loop . see the right_panel of fig . 11 . the contribution from top_quark is UNK .
