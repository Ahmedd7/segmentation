[ 6 ] who use the continuum - discretized coupledchannels ( cdcc ) method [ 7 ] . in the cdcc theory , the 8be continuum is simulated by approximate , squareintegrable wave_functions . the cdcc method provides a consistent way to include the α + α continuum in the calculation of the triple - α reaction_rate . however , as the involved resonances are narrow , theBR. phys . a : math . gen . 35 , 177 - 189 . avetisov , v . a . , bikulov , a . h . , osipov , v . a . , 2002b , p - adic description of characteristic relaxation in complex systems , arxiv . org : cond - mat / 0210447 beltrametti , e . , and cassinelli , g . , 1972 , quantum_mechanics and p - adic_numbers . found . of physics 2 , 1 – 7 . dragovich , b . , and dragovich , a . , 2006 , a p - adic model of dna_sequence and genetic_code , q - bio . gn / 0607018 . dubischar d . , gundlach v . m . , steinkamp o . , khrennikov a . yu . , 1999 , a p - adic model for the process of thinking disturbed byBRpk let m ( n , k ) be the algebra obtained from mn by splitting the atom a1 ∈ i = 1 bi ) . the forbidden diversity cycles are ( ai , ai , ai ) for 2 ≤ i ≤ n together_with ( bi , bj , bl ) , for 1 ≤ i , j , l ≤ k . by [ 4 , theorem 3 ] , m ( n , k ) is an integral relation algebra . observe , since all elements are self - converse , r ; s ≥ 1 ′ ⇐_⇒ r · s 6 = 0 for r , s ∈ m ( n , k ) , and ifBRUNK e UNK χ β ( yy ′ ) UNK π vu ( α ) ∩ π wu ( β ) = ∅ ba2 α bb2 + x α , β π vu ( α ) ∩ π wu ( β ) 6 = ∅ ba2 α bb2 e UNK χ α ( xx ′ ) χ β ( yy ′ ) UNK . β β ( 46 ) 18 ∅ ∅ obtain , it is easy to see that lemma 5 . 2 implies that e [ χ α ( xx ′ ) ] e [ χ β ( yy ′ ) ] ≥ − ε / 2 . thus , the first summation − ε / 2 . using this we α UNK UNK p β bb2 − ( ε / 2 ) UNK p α ba2 ∅ bb2 in the rhs of equation ( 46 ) is at_least ba2 ∅ + x α , β e UNK a ( x ) a ( x ′ ) b ( x ) b ( y ′ ) UNK ≥ ba2 ∅ bb2 π vu ( α ) ∩ π wu ( β ) 6 = ∅ ba2 α bb2 u + ev , w ___ x α , β y , y ′ UNK a ( x ) a ( x ′ ) b ( x ) b ( y ′ ) UNK ≥ p4 π vu ( α ) ∩ π wu ( β ) 6 = ∅ ba2 α bb2 β UNK = ba2 ∅ bb2 e UNK χ α ( xx ′ ) χ β ( yy ′ ) UNK − e UNKBR- free family of solutions 6 . these are the solutions of the eigenvalue_problem curlv = κ v ( 4 . 3 ) where the scalar function κ may or may not be a constant . suppose it is not a constant , then using eq .
