( 24 ) ( 25 ) ( 26 ) from the momentum_space eigenfunction in eq . ( 22 ) , it appears that a continuous infinity of λ will satisfy the differential_equation in eq . ( 21 ) . however , we find that λ = n + m µ are the only eigenvalues we find in the spectrum . the question that we ask is what is the sanctity of these λ = n + m µ and why are the other values of λ unacceptable ? in order to answer this question , we now look_at the asymptotic_behavior of the two_linearly_independent_solutions in the position space for the eigenvalue equationBRa short time than case4 . however , for 0 < α < 3 . 0 , this case , as_well as case3m1 , seems to deviate_slightly from the force - free state . in comparison , figure 4 ( b ) , which shows a distribution map of the force - free α in the initial_state , shows a better force - free state than case1m2 even for α > 0 . hence , this error is clearly derived_from an interpolation through a change in the grid that critically affects the value of 1 − em , as reported by jiang & feng ( 2012 ) . 3 . 5 . 2d distribution of the force - free α figure 7 ( a ) plots contours of the force - free α to clarify_why the reconstructed field in the region of weak force - free α ( 0 < α < 3 . 0 ) deviated_from the force - free state when the multi - grid - type method is used , as such as shown in figures 5 and 6 . the red , green , and blue_contours indicate strengths of the force - free α corresponding to 2 . 0 , − 2 . 0 , and − 4 . 0 , respectively . from figure 7 ( a ) , a region of strong force - free α appears in the central_region , where the extrapolated field satisfies the force - free state well , as shown in the previous – 14 – results . on the other_hand regions of weak negative and positive force - free α , r1 and r2 lie at considerable distances from the central_region in the numerical domain where the forcefree α isBR18 ] h . hatanaka and t . hashi , physics_letters a 67 , 183 ( 1978 ) .
