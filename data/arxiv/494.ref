( 13 ) ( 14 ) it is this quantity that determines the temperature increase of the metal_nanoparticle . we take the entire nanoparticle to be heated uniformly by this amount of energy . the initial temperature increase of the nanoparticle is then given by a modified_version of eq . ( 6 ) , ∆ t0 = eef f / cn . ( 15 ) let_us_assume_that the detector is operating at some uniform background temperature tun . for example , it might_be at_room_temperature tr . then the entire nanoparticle is initially heated by the wimp interaction to t0 = tun + ∆ t0 . ( 16 ) in time , the temperature increase of the nanoparticle due_to the wimp interaction dissipates . we will now solve the heat_transfer equation in order to follow the evolution of the temperature_profile t ( r , t ) . this allows_us_to calculate the temperature near a single nanoparticle as a function of time in orderBR. phys . a , 26 ( 1993 ) l641 .

figure 1 ) , there are galaxies in the region between the star - forming and quiescent sequences , making their classification rather arbitrary and causing cross - contamination of the two classes ( also see holden et_al . 2012 ) . motivated_by this_work , we take this misclassification_probability to be 10 % . we will comment_on the effects of varying this parameter below , when we describe the fitting results . the misclassification_probability precisely corresponds_to the early - and late - type contamination fractions in a sample in cases where the two sub - samples have an equal number of galaxies . the actual contamination fraction scales with the early - , and late - type fractions , which depend_on galaxy mass and redshift . the evolution of the stellar_mass function for the two_types is described by muzzin_et_al .
