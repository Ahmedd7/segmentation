ito_process adapted to this filtration . such an approach to the pricing of commodities and related derivatives is in line with the “ standard ” modelling framework for asset_pricing , within which much of modern financial_engineering has_been_carried_out . a fundamental methodological issue arising in the standard framework is that the market_filtration is fixed in an essentially ad_hoc way , and that no_indication is provided concerning the nature of the information it purports to convey , or why it is relevant to the price . the information is in practice typically no_more_than that of the price_movements themselves , so it can hardly be claimed in any useful way that the price_movements are taking_place “ in response ” to “ shocks ” associated_with the arrival of information . one_knows , however , that in real_markets , information concerning the possible future_cash_flows and other benefits orBRconsequence of the strong surface_roughness . this effect was known since many_decades and recently , has fully been explained [ 8 ] . it affects more to primary electrons of lower_energies , just the most_important part of sey for the multipactor discharge . this effect is more_pronounced for materials with higher first cross - over energy . it is a classical macroscopic effect ( no quantum physics ) and it has_been_observed for sizes from 50 nm to several millimetres [ 8 ] . our results also provide_direct_evidence of the reduction of sey using micro - structured magnetized surfaces . the local magnetic_field of these surfaces can modify the secondary electron trajectories making_them to return back to the surface so that they are more_easily reabsorbed . results and discussion the titanium_nitride ( tin ) coatings have good properties to prevent multipactor effect in rf wave_guides as_well as they can solve the multipacting problems of high power mw in particle_accelerators . there is active_research in this field . the difficulty in obtaining a tin_coating to prevent multipactor lies in the poor stability of the sey coefficient after long_exposures to air , or to contamination in the vacuum_chamber during subsystem and further " conditioning " , see fig . 1 . qualification satellite tests and deterioration of tin sey properties because of long exposure to air can_be recovered by different treatments ( ion / electron_bombardment or surface conditioning by vacuum heat_treatments ) once the surface is under vacuum for operation . however , tin surface conditioning treatments are in space applications . figures 2 ( a ) and ( b ) show the sem ( scanning_electron_microscope ) images of a bilayer coating : ( a ) gold_coated anomag ( corrosion protection coating for mg ) on magnesium andBR. we define the following increments on the grid times 0 , 1 , . . . , n : g ( k ) = bh k − bh k − 1 , 1 ≤ k ≤ n , ( 5 ) and the n - dimensional fractional_gaussian_noise ( abbreviated to fgn ) vector g : gn = { g ( k ) : 1 ≤ k ≤ n } .

meaningful physical_quantities in orthodox_quantum_mechanics or classical field_theory , these_quantities are routinely measured and used for applications in optics . a meaningful quantum description of the spin and orbital am of light was_recently provided by_several_authors , which describes separately_conserved and measurable integral values of these_quantities . however , the electromagnetic_field theory still_lacks corresponding locally - conserved spin and orbital am currents . in this_paper , we construct these missing spin and orbital am densities and fluxes that satisfy the proper continuity equations . we show that these are physically_measurable and conserved_quantities . these are , however , not lorentzcovariant , so only make_sense in the single laboratory_reference_frame of the measurement probe . the fluxes we derive improve the canonical ( non - conserved ) spin and orbital am fluxes , and include a ‘ spin - orbit ’ term that describes the spinorbit_interaction effects observed in nonparaxial optical fields . we also consider both standard and dual - symmetric versions of the electromagnetic_field theory . applying the general theory to nonparaxial optical vortex_beams validates_our results and allows_us_to discriminate_between earlier approaches to the problem . our treatment yields the complete and consistent description of the spin and orbital am of free maxwell fields in both quantum -
