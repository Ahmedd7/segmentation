[ 26 ] ) . consequently , a connection_between the acceleration region and the other charged region could neutralize the acceleration region ∼ 800 ms before the optical_flash was observed , resulting in the termination of the electron_acceleration . then , the field region might not recover to a high_enough level to accelerate_electrons to relativistic energies , at_least until the end of the intracloud lightning event . another_interesting_observation , in addition to the relationship with the lightning flash , was that the measured duration of the present event , 163 s , is 2 − 4 times_longer_than thatBR5 . 1 the definition let ( l ε ) ε > 0 be a family of sets , each one contained in l ρ and such that l ε_ց { x0 } as ε → 0 . this means that l ε ⊂ l ε ′ whenever ε < ε ′ and ∩ ε > 0l ε = { x0 } . below , we will see some examples based_on distances and on mixtures . definition 5 . 1 the local measure of model risk associated to ρ , x0 and the family ( l ε ) ε > 0 is lm = lim ε → 0 rm ( x0 , l ε ) = lim ε → 0 ρ (BR, b .
