diagram of electric and magnetic_properties . when growing lsmo on sto or other substrates , such as lsat , it is of relevance to determine_whether the substrate terminations replicate at the film free surface or not . this question can_be recast by asking if the ao or bo2 terminations of the films mimic those of the substrate . the answer to this question could_be extremely relevant when integrating lsmo - like thin_films in sandwich_structures , such as tunnel_junctions , where properties are known to be largely_determined by the chemical nature of the interface . a first insight_into this crucial_issue can_be obtained by growing lsmo films on sto or lsat_substrates , assessing and controlling the growth mechanism by rheed and subsequently exploring the morphologyBRcorresponding distribution of lateral positions is given by a gaussian 8k 3 r dy π 3 2 , t ( 16 ) UNK x2 UNK = px ( x , t ) = x2 exp UNK − yt3 UNK √ ( 4 / 9 π ) k2d3 4q ( 64 / 9 ) π k2d3 yt3 .

( 2 ) in the limit α → 0 , and due_to complete_integrability in terms of inverse_scattering transformation it conserves an_infinite number of integrals of motion where wave action , momentum and hamiltonian h = hd + h4 are the first three ones . however , direct investigation of waves statistics in the framework of eq . ( 2 ) turns_out_to be not very_informative since the system exhibits relaxation phenomena - statistically irreversible movement to it ’_s statistical attractor in the form of one big soliton containing all the potential energy and immersed in the small fluctuations field ( same for eq . ( 3 ) - see [ 16 ] for both systems ) . and even_though for small time shifts the dynamics of eq . ( 2 ) resembles that of the classical nls_equation , for larger time shifts it demonstrates significantly_different behavior . in particular , our test simulations revealed that after some time energy of higher - order nonlinear interactions h6 becomes_comparable with energy of four - waves interactions h4 and kinetic_energy hd . at this pointBRxi , r sg = n ( n − 1 ) c + h2 − k α k2 , respectively . thus , under the hypothesis of theorems 2 and 3 we immediately derive that sg ≥ 0 in the case when c > 0 . low_energy canonical immersions 9 proof of theorem 2 . suppose that m ֒_→ sn + p is a critical_point of ψ of constant_mean_curvature function . by theorem 7 , we must have that ei ν 1k2 − h2 + 2trace a2 ν 1 ) d µ g . ν 1 is nonnegative and bounded above by k α k2 . by ( 4 ) it_follows ( 19 ) now the trace of a2 that 0 = 2z h ∆ hd µ g = z h2 ( 2n − 2k ∇ ν − λ UNK h2 ≤ n − k ∇ ν ei ν 1k2 − 1 2 2 h2 + trace a2 ν 1 ≤ n − k ∇ ν is nonnegative and cannot_be zero if h 6 = 0 . if h = 0 then ∇ ν ν 1 = 0 , and we have then that 0 ≤ k α k2 ≤ n . the desired_result now follows by theorem 1 . indeed , UNK 1 the clifford_torus sm ( pm / n ) × sn − m ( p ( n − m ) / n ) , 1 ≤ m < n , have principal_curvatures ± p ( n − m ) / m and ∓ pmBRof course be highly context dependent and we_propose using qualitative explorative methods to investigate the sensitivity of the choice of kl radius c . these are illustrated in section 5 . 1 and further explained in the discussion in section 6 . 4 . 1 . 2 comments on the use of γ = { π : kl ( π UNK π i ) < c } exploring only the best or worst possible_outcomes within a given kl ball may be_seen as restrictive and unrealistic . the minimax solution assumes a reactive zero - sum game leading to a different solution to any particular action chosen , in conflict with the notion of a stable nature . to counter this argument we can restrict_attention to small neighbourhoods ( see the discussion in chapter 1 of hansen &_sargent ( 2008 ) ) . an_alternative is to look_at the distribution of expected losses over all models π ∈ γ . however it is not clear_how one can enumerate this or compute with the space of distributions as defined by γ = { π : kl ( π UNK π i ) < c } . it_turns_out_that by changing the neighbourhood from kl ( π UNK π i ) to kl ( π i UNK π ) a numerical_solution exists . however it should_be noted that this is at the expense of
