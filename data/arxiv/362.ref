the displacement of the oscillators reduces their overlap , suppressing the tunneling_amplitude to a value ∆ r UNK ∆ . extending this argument to low_frequency modes ( ω k UNK ∆ ) reveals a problem : the largeBR, versus chemical_potential , µ , exhibits plateaux when ρ takes on integer values . the critical_interaction_strength is now known to very_high_precision , e . g . taking the value ( t / u ) c = 0 . 05974 ( 3 ) for a square lattice5 . with longer range_interactions , these plateaux can develop at non - integer_fillings as_well . for example , a sufficiently_large near - neighbor_repulsion v1 drives a checkerboard solid order at ρ = 1 2 on a square lattice6 . likewise , a next - near - neighbor_repulsion v2 can cause stripe ordering at the same filling . both patterns of charge_ordering are accompanied_by a non - zero gap . long_range ( e . g . dipolar ) interactions give_rise_to a complex ” devil_’_s staircase ” structure in ρ ( µ ) 7 , 8 . the number of plateaux which develop increases with system size , indicating the presence of frustration8 . another fascinating , and experimentally_realizable , mechanism which produces mi phases at fractional fillings is the presence of a superlattice superimposed_on the optical_lattice . these superlattice fractional filling mi phases are expectedBRgc - domain to measure the melting_temperatures t at m , respectively . open ( t ) / n at m and t gc open ( t ) , at t = t at equilibrated snapshot dna beacon of an metadynamics simulations thermodynamic_properties . because of its convergence properties , well - tempered_metadynamics ( wtmetad ) is the most widely_adopted version of the metadynamcis algorithm [ s9 ] . in wt - metad , the bias deposition_rate decreases over simulation time and the dynamics of all the microscopic variables becomes_progressively closer to thermodynamic_equilibrium as the simulation proceeds , making the bias to converge to its limiting value in a single run and avoiding the problem of overfilling , ie . when the height of the accumulated gaussians largely_exceeds the true barrier_height . thus one prevents the system from being irreversibly pushed in regions of configuration_space which are not physically_relevant . its success depends_on the critical choice of a reasonable number of relevant collective_variables ( cvs ) . all the relevant slow varying_degrees of freedom must_be described by the cvs . in addition , the number of cvs must_be small_enough to avoid exceedingly long computational time , while being_able to distinguish_among the different conformational_states of the system . however , to correctly_describe the free - energy_landscape , it is not necessary that the cvs chosen in metad properly_account_for all the states and barriers . actually , they must mainly account for the relevant barriers associated_with coarse - grained variables on which the free - energy dependence is the most_important . in the particular case of the slow closure mechanism of bubble denaturation studied in this_letter with the mesoscopic model , severalBR. the longtime evolution of these functions after the driving_field was cut_off and acceleration had stopped was treated_quantum_mechanically , in order to account for quantum revivals of the released rotational wave_packets . figure 2a shows our results for the spectrum of the oppositely circularly_polarized signal at the output of the medium as a function of the probe_delay with_respect_to the start of the centrifuge . the calculated signal shows good qualitative and quantitative_agreement_with the results of the reported experimental_observations [ 25 ] ( see fig . 2b ) . at the acceleration stage , it exhibits linearly_growing frequency_shift corresponding to twice the instantaneous rotation frequency of the centrifuge . in the field - free regime ( after the end of the centrifuge at ∼ 60 ps ) , the excited rotational_wavepacket produces a revival oscillatory_pattern of the signal_strength , as shown in the insets of fig . 2 . the revival period changes with time because of the centrifugal_distortion effect in the molecular rotafigure 1 .

[ 11 ] semiconducting tmd monolayers offer properties that are distinct from those of their parental bulk forms . such layer - dependent properties have_recently_attracted great_attention for possible applications in nano - and optoelectronics . several semiconducting tmds undergo a transition from the indirect_band_gap 2h forms to the direct_band_gap 1h - monolayers , as e . g . in the case of mos2 , the prototypical tmd material .
