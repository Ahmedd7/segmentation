for the unapproximated theory and for the classical statistical approximation ) . since the full theory is renormalizable , this function should not have ultraviolet_divergences at 1 - loop , since such divergences would not be renormalizable . however , since the csa discards certain terms , it not obvious a priori that this conclusion still_holds . for the sake of definiteness , let_us_denote p1 , ·_·_· , p4 the external_momenta of this function ( defined to be incoming into the graph , therefore p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 = 0 ) , and let_us_assume_that the two indices 1 are attached to the legs p1 , p2 and the two indices 2 are attached to the legs p3 , p4 . at one loop , this 4 - point function ( in the full field_theory ) receives the following contributions : − i γ 1 loop 1122 = UNK UNK UNK s channel UNK + + + UNK UNK +BR, which allows_us_to introduce the simulations performed in this_paper . section 2 . 2 describes the dynamical component of the algorithm and is divided in five parts : § 2 . 2 . 1 and 2 . 2 . 2 comment_briefly_on our time integration scheme and on the way we circulate along the orientated_polygon to solve poisson_equation ; § 2 . 2 . 3 deals_with local refinement and questions the potential virtues of unrefinement ; finally , § 2 . 2 . 4 discusses diagnostics , calculation of the value of the time step and energy_conservation . 2 . 1 initial_condition generation and presentation of the simulations a natural_way to sample initial_conditions consists in defining each waterbag as the area_enclosed between two successive isocontours of the phase - space distribution function . the isocontours are chosen such as to bound the mean 3 the connecting parts between two isocontours do_not_contribute to the dynamics . 4 s . colombi & j . touma figure 1 . the main_steps of our waterbag algorithm . square difference_between the true and the sampled ( stepwise ) phase - space distribution function weighted by the waterbag thickness , which means that local intercontour spacing roughly scales like 1 / p ∇ f where ∇ f is the magnitude of the gradient of the phase - space distribution function . to draw the isocontours , we use the so - called marching square algorithm , inspired from its famous three - dimensional alterego ( lorensen & cline 1987 ) . additional technical_details can_be found in appendixBRwhile the elements of the cell_cycle as system states are not questioned , the identification of cell_cycle as cell state requires experimental_verification , as will be shown later . in the case of he - la cells the elementary states in the cell_cycle are called mitosis and interphase . naturally are observed events like cell_death , cell fusion , anomalous cell_division etc . the reality is that the manual analysis of the 3500 to 5000 images allows the operator to notify only mitosis and interphase and the cellular neighbourhood of observed cells . figure 5 shows a series of datasets in the course of manual analysis and example of corresponding sub - graphs . the sub - graph showing fate of the cell followed from the point of view of the individual cell as system element ( fig . 5b ) is a reflection of the model according_to which cells communicate only by direct long - term physical contacts . the cell_fate itself and any change in number of its_neighbours are noted . the sub - graph showing cell_fate from the point of view of the whole system ( figure_5c ) is an expanded_version based_on the fi figure_5a . cell monolayer culture image no . 2 ( 1 min ) , 1000 ( 999 min ) and 2500 ( 2499 min ) of the time - lapse experiment . the cell discussed in subsequent graphs is denoted_by the red_dot . assumption that any change in any cell is notified ( i . e . through signal molecules ) by all the cells . from data obtained in this way , one mayBRis forced to truncate the resonance spectrum and just the lightest resonance multiplets are included 1 . the r χ t lagrangian is built in such a way that it fulfills the discrete_symmetries of qcd and chiral_symmetry . it contains an even [ 8 , 9 , 15 ] and an odd intrinsic - parity_sector [ 16 , 17 ] , where the latter produces contributions to anomalous amplitudes in qcd . nonetheless , it should_be pointed_out that , apart_from the wzw_term , the r χ t interactions are chiral invariant . although qcd fixes the hadronic couplings , these cannot_be determined based_on chiral_symmetry considerations alone . a priori , they are free_parameters of our r χ t action and chiral_symmetry just provides relations_between particular processes . however , demanding a short - distance behaviour in accordance_with qcd and its operator product_expansion ( ope ) [ 18 ] will_allow_us_to extract important constraints between couplings like ,BR) kea : practical automatic keyphrase_extraction . in proceedings of the fourth acm_conference_on digitallibrarie , pp . 254 - 255 .
