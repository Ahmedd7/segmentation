the two russian scientists . ) • in tandem with their study of quantum effects near black_holes , zeldovich and starobinsky began a systematic_investigation into quantum effects which occur during the early_stages of the universe when it was expanding very_rapidly . quantum field_theory informs_us that , far_from being empty , the vacuum is actually seething with activity in the form of virtual particle - antiparticle_pairs in the constant process of creation and distruction . from the uncertainty_principle ∆ e ∆ t ≥  we_know that such pairs ( of mass 2m ) come_into existence for a very_short time ∆ t ≤  / 2mc2 . if an electric_field is applied to the vacuum then , for a sufficiently_large value ( ecr ) , the work done ( δ w ) on the virtual pair can become equal to the total rest mass 2mc2 : δ w = λ ceecr ≃ 2mc2 , ( 2 ) 6 where the compton length λ c =  / mc provides an estimate of the separation_between particle and antiparticle . the critical field value at which the vacuum becomes_unstable to particle - antiparticle production , ecr ≃ m2c3 / e  , is called the schwinger limit , after julian_schwinger who_discovered it in 1951 .

( 20 ) it_has_been_pointed_out recently that the coarse - grained entropy obeys anomalous_scaling that is somehow different from the finite - entanglement scaling in quantum 1d systems near_criticality , because the snapshot density_matrix roughly_corresponds to the two - point spin correlation_function rather_than a state itself [ 7 – 9 ] . in this viewpoint , holographic transformation only appears on the full snapshot entropy . the finite - entanglement scaling is given by and the recently_proposed scaling is given by 1 ln χ , s χ = p12 / c + 1 s χ = b χ η ln UNK χ a UNK , ( 21 ) ( 22 ) where η is the anomalous_dimension , and in the ising case we have ηBRdifferent hardware and software concepts together , creating the possibility to interconnect real tuis with virtual tuis ( vtuis ) . using the same toolkit for intelligent environments , robots and tuis , a common middleware reduces the amount of code that has to be_written to establish the communication between these_kinds of systems . the middleware already provides_us_with basic messages and communication_protocols to transfer any kind of data between different nodes . for the virtual development process , ros does_not_depend_on existing hardware . the developers are completely free in designing the communication with other tuis and smart things . 3d simulation of physical objects with gazebo the 3d simulation is performed with gazebo [ 14 ] , a 3d robot simulator . gazebo is a complete physical simulation of robots including shapes , joints , contacts , collisions , and friction . gazebo utilized the 3d framework ogre ( objectoriented graphics rendering_engine ) 3 for rendering the environment and objects . it uses the open dynamics engine ( ode ) 4 library as physics engine that can simulate rigid_body_dynamics . during the simulation , gazebo publishes the models ’ states and behaviors via the ros middleware ’_s communication_infrastructure so that all other nodes can use these parameters for triggering certain actions . gazebo uses urdf ( unified robot description format ) 5 files for the description of the models . the physical elements for the simulation can_be modeled with all common 3d modeling tools such as blender6 , cinema4d7 , autodesk maya8BRobservables in strongly_coupled_anisotropic theories , ” pos_corfu_2012 , 122 ( 2013 ) [ arxiv_: 1306 . 1404 [_hep - th ] ] .
