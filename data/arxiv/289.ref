] where n is the number of amino_acid_residues in a protein and ζ = 1 + γ with γ being the exponent that characterizes the divergence of the susceptibility at the critical_point for a n - component ferromagnet with n = 0 , corresponding to a self - avoiding_walk - a reasonable model that describes the global properties of unfolded proteins . an accurate numerical estimate based_on a fifth order  expansion of φ 4 field_theory for a polymer gives γ ≈ 1 . 22 , leading to the conclusion that ω c ∼ n 1 . 22 . we showed [ 13 ] that experiments on a number of proteins are in accord_with this universal prediction . f dt the rationale for expecting the universal behavior for ω c goes as follows : ( 1 ) by analogy with magnetic systems we can identify fn ba as an order parameter that distinguishes_between the folded and unfolded states , and hence t dfn ba can_be associated_with ” susceptibility ” with t being the ordering field .

[ 9 ] ) . we refer the reader to [ 11 ] for a discussion of these and other connections . so_far , there are very_few families of graphs for which the critical groups have_been_found , so it is of some interest to compute the smith and critical groups for some wellknown families of graphs . in this note we treat the paley graphs . let q = pt be a fixed prime_power with q ≡ 1 ( mod 4 ) . the paley graph paley ( q ) is defined by taking the field fq as vertex set , with two vertices x and y joined by an edge if and only if x − y is a nonzero square in fq . the degree of each vertex is k = q − 1 2 . let a denote the adjacency_matrix and l = kiBRpotential . thus this sector of the reduced theory is equivalent to two dimensional upside_down anharmonic_oscillator . close to the minimum of the potential γ behaves_as a pertubative ghost with zero mass . however at any non - vanishing distance from the minimum , the signs of kinetic and potential energies are opposite and γ behaves_as a tachyon . thus the perturbative ghost problem is not cured , but is rather exacerbated by nonlinear gravitational_interactions . thinking_about quantization , it is clear that the theory does_not_allow sensible quantization via standard methods , i . e . using standard dirac norm . the possibility that the use of a nonstandard norm , like in [ 15 ] could_lead to a unitary theory may be worth_exploring , although such a procedure is rather non intuitive . finally we note_that another_way to view the present calculation is as a study of possible homogeneous cosmologies in conformal_gravity . the universe described by eqs .
