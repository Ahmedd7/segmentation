( of course it is possible that such other - than - 1 outcome appears three times in a row , but that is definitely unlikely . ) on the other_hand , when playing for two straight doubles , one has in practice four chancesBRv = vf . otherwise it would satisfy a 0 dirichlet_condition for which the only solution vanishes_everywhere . this can_be seen thanks to the dual equation which has a super - solution . a direct way to see this is to integrate by parts ( 11 ) against a weight φ ( v , g ) ; if p vanishes at v = 0 and v = vf we have σ e ∂ g φ ( v , g ) − a σ e 0 ∂ g φ ( v , 0 ) p ( v , 0 ) dv . ∂ 2 gg φ ( v , g ) UNK UNK dvdg 1 σ e ( λ ( g − ν ) − a λ 2 ) UNK dvdg ≥ 0 .
