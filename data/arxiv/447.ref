20 mhz , which is dictated_by the absorption bandwidth of the respective quantum memory they were developed for . the coherence_time τ c ∼ 1 ~ ∆ ν of the photons_produced can therefore be as long as a microsecond , which impacts on the rate at which those photons can_be distributed . it is therefore desirable for the quantum memory to absorb over a large bandwidth to increase the photon distribution rate . in this_article , we present a cw - pumped source of polarization - entangled_photon_pairs with 240 mhz linewidth using a direct filtering approach . this source was_designed for experiments involving quantum_memories based_on the atomic_frequency_comb protocol ( afc ) [ 21 ] in a nd : yso crystal . earlier_versions of this source produced energy - time entangled_photons with a smaller linewidth , and was used to demonstrate the quantum storage of photonic_entanglement in a crystal [ 22 ] , heralded_entanglement of two crystals [ 23 ] and the storage of heralded polarization qubits [ 24 ] . recently , the source described in this_paper was used to demonstrate the teleportation from a telecom - wavelength photon to a solid - state quantum memory [ 25 ] . we note_that a similar source , based_on a pulsed_pump , was used for the storage of broadband time - bin entangled_photons in a tm : linbo3 waveguide [ 26 ] . the paper is organized_as_follows . we give the requirements for the photon - pair source in sec . ii . the concept behind the implementation is given in secBRthe real_part of the ρ k component obtained using both methods . y ( a ) x ( b ) x figure 10 : comparison of the ρ k component of the sensitivity gradient to baseflow perturbations ∇ wb λ q obtained with ( a ) : the modififed elsa code , and ( b ) : the fully_discrete method . to validate the gradient , we then compared , for an_arbitrary direction w1 , the eigenvalue variation obtained with the gradient , δ λ = UNK ∇ wb λ , w1 UNK , to the eigenvalue variation obtained with a finite_difference method , δ λ 1 = [ λ ( wb + β w1 ) − λ ( wb ) ] . for this , the jacobians jwb + β w1 and jwb are 1 β extracted and their spectrum computed . note_that the discrete evaluation of δ λ 1 is a complex issue in itself : the baseflow perturbation β w1 shall be small compared to the baseflow although its various components may scale differently from one another . in order to ease the computation of δ λ 1 , we can use the fact that by linearity the full perturbation effect of β w1 can_be computed from the contributions of its various components separately . we_chose w1 = wb along with a small value for β and restricted w1 to each conservative variable independently , so that we perturb each quantity on the full domain one at a time . 31 we summarized in table 6 the relative difference δ λ 1 − δ λ δ λ between both eigenvalue variation prediction . we observe_that the gradient is correctly evaluated up to within 3 % for the spalart -

waves , primarily because the r - waves have smaller values of λ k and thus longer wave lengths , making_them couple more effectively to the tidal_potential . conversely , in the retrograde g - wave region where q ≈ 4 ( which appears as the blue slice above the r - wave region ) , neither r - waves nor g - waves are effective in generating tidal_dissipation ( although a precise understanding of the nature of tidal_dissipation in this regions remains hampered_by our use of the traditional approximation ) . finally , weBRthe ( maximum_entropy ) model t ( 2 ) can_be given as λ h ( t ( 2 ) ) : = h ( t ( 2 ) ) / h ( t ( 2 ) ) . ( 5 ) this ratio ranges between 0 for transition matrices generating deterministic contact sequences and 1 for the case t ( 2 ) representing markovian temporal_networks . a value of λ h ( t ( 2 ) ) < 1 highlights that the statistics of two - paths deviates_from what is expected based_on the first - order aggregate network . as such , λ h is a simple measure capturing the importance of non - markovian properties in temporal_networks . diffusion in temporal_networks . an_interesting_aspect of the second - order representation g ( 2 ) is that temporal transitivity holds , i . e . the existence of edges ( e1 , e2 ) and ( e2 , e3 ) in g ( 2 ) implies that a time - respecting path e1 → e2 → e3 exists in the temporal network gt 5 . this enables the use of algebraic methods and hence to relate diffusion dynamics in temporal_networks with spectral properties of the matrix t ( 2 ) . in particular , the convergence time of random_walksBRhands - free systems in a car during rain . for our experiments , we use rain sound that has_been recorded at 16 khz sampling_rate by an akg - q400 microphone placed on the mirror of a car that is moving at 60 km / hr . the clean_speech signal is taken from the timit_database ; it is first convolved_with an impulse - response that simulates the channel between the driver ’_s mouth and the car microphone before being mixed with the recorded rain - sound . the mixing_ratio between the clean_speech signal and impulse_noise is adjusted to a realistic car - environment level . to process the signal , the speech_signal is divided_into_blocks each of length 512 with 50 percent overlap . the daubechies_wavelet transform of order 6 is applied on each of the blocks for analysis ; after that , we apply our proposed_method to suppress wavelet_coefficients that correspond_to rain impulses . finally , we apply the inverse_wavelet_transform on the modified wavelet_coefficients to transform it back to the time domain . to remove edge effects when combining the time - domain blocks , a hanning_window is applied on each of the blocks before_performing the overlap - and - add . once the impulses have_been suppressed standard noise_removal techniques [ 10 , 11BRdynamic chaos ( ndc ) volatility model , autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity ( arch ) model , generalized_autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity ( garch ) model , value at risk ( var ) . 1 the well designed , perfectly optimized and efficiently operated financial system is a main foundation of prosperous developed society with the market_economy as it is explained in the political_economy in landes ( 1998 ) ;
