, such as the flatness and horizon problems , the problem of unwanted relics , such as magnetic_monopoles , and produces the cosmological fluctuations for the formation of the structure that we observe today . the spectacular cmb_data , first from the wmap_satellite [ 2 ] and recently from planck [ 3 ] , have strengthen the inflationary idea , since the observations indicate an almost scalefree spectrum of gaussian adiabatic density_fluctuations , just as predicted by simple models of inflation . however , inflation is not a theory yet , as we don_’_t know_how to integrate it with ideas from particle_physics . the brout - englert - higgs_mechanism [ 4 ] in the framework of the standard_model breaks electroweak_symmetry , gives masses to the charged_fermions and the massive_gauge_bosons , and predicts the existence of the higgs_boson . the recent lhc discovery of the higgs_boson [ 5 ] completed the particle spectrum predicted by the standard_model , and indicates for the first time that fundamental scalar particles exist in nature . therefore , it is a natural thing to assume_that inflation is driven by the higgs_boson . although the higgs_potential is not suitable for a viable inflationary_model , the presence of a higgs non - minimal_coupling to gravity can change things to the better . a large value of the non - minimal_coupling ξ ∼ 104 is required , and given the uncertainties in the top_quark_mass and the strong_coupling_constant the model is still allowed [ 6 ] . sadly , that large value of ξ ≫ 1 questions the validity of the scenario in the sm_higgs inflation , as the inflationary_scale exceeds the effective ultraviolet_cut - off scale [ 7 ] . as it was realized long_ago , radiative_corrections can_be the origin of electroweak_symmetry_breaking [BR, differentiable and sufficiently_smooth . the key_idea is to first use causal calculus to find out the observational probabilities needed to calculate the causal_effects and then estimate these observational probabilities from the data using flexible models from the 2 arsenal of modern data analysis . the estimated causal_effects cannot_be expressed in a closed - form but can_be numerically_calculated for any input . the approach works if the required observational probabilities can_be reliably interpolated or extrapolated from the model fitted to the data . data missing at random creates an_additional challenge for the estimation . multiple_imputation ( rubin , 1987 ) of missing_data works_well with the idea of flexible nonparametric modeling because in multiple_imputation an incomplete dataset is transformed to multiple complete datasets for which the parameters can estimated separately from other imputed datasets . the estimation_procedure is given in detail in section 2 . an example demonstrating the estimation of complex nonlinear causal_effects is presented in section 3 . conclusions are given in section 4 . 2 estimation of causal_effects a straightforward approach for the estimation of causal_effects is to first to define the causal model explicitly in a parametric form up to some unknown_parameters and then use data to estimate these parameters . for instance , in linear gaussian models , the causal_effects are specified by the linear models with unknown regression_coefficients that can_be estimated on the basis of the sample_covariance_matrix calculated from the data . this approach may_turn_out to be difficult to implement when the functional_forms of the causal_relationships are complex or unknown because it is not clear_how the parametric model should specified and how its parameters could_be estimated from the data . the estimation_procedure proposed here utilizes nonparametric modeling of causal_effects . it is assumed that the causal_structureBRphys . rev . b 60 ( 1999 ) 1441 .
