( 2005 ) studied the release time of mev / n protons and heliums observed by soho / erne . they found that the delay in seps release time derived_from vda method is related to the poor magnetic connection_between the flare site and the spacecraft . for extremely_high energy particle events , reames ( 2009 ) studied the onset time of ion fluxes in ground - level enhancements . they found that the time difference_between the solar particle release time and the onset time of metric type_ii_radio_burst increases with the angular_distance of the observer_’ s magnetic foot - point and the source increase . according_to different heliographic_latitude observation , zhang et_al .

selection for this object in table 1 , where the log z - column ( normalised to highest ) shows the computed evidence . finally , the derived posterior parameters are shown . a power_law model ( powerlaw ) does_not_provide a good_fit . this can_be seen in the deviations between model and data points in the upper_left_panel , and also in the fact that this model has the lowest evidence of all models table 1 ( column 5 ) . furthermore , the derived photon_index , γ = 0 . 8 ± 0 . 05 is unlikely and would_constitute a 7 σ outlier . obscuration is expected in some sources , and the wabs model indeed improves the fit . the model follows the spectrum much_closer ( upper_right_panel in figure 5 ) with a line -
