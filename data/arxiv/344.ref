based_on the context , the learner can select one of its_own actions ( which gives a reward and provides information ) or request assistance from another learner . in the latter_case , the requester pays a cost and receives the reward but the provider learns the information . in our framework , learners are modeled as cooperative contextual_bandits . each learner seeks to maximize the expected_reward from its arrivals , which involves trading_off the reward received from its_own actions , the information learned from its_own actions , the reward received from the actions requested of others and the cost_paid for these actions - taking_into_account what it has learned_about the value of assistance from each_other learner . we develop distributed online_learning_algorithms and provide analytic boundsBRof height i or_less , we define qcell ( q , i ) for its ( unique ) ancestor at level i . we fix the following additional parameters : set q ℓ : = ( 1 + e 2 ) ℓ for any integer ℓ . let d a denote the integer such that q d a ≤ a < q d a + 1 . furthermore , we define ha as the integer such that 2ha ≤ a eq 3 √ d ≤ 2ha + 1 . : = d a and h : = ha . to give a rough intuition_about the chosen terms , the approximate complex will be only changwhen there is no_ambiguity about a , we will skip the suffixes and write d ing at discrete values ;
