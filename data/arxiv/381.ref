[ 19 ] ) that any system of equations of the form ( d + ω ) c ( x ) = 0 , d = dx a ∂ ∂ x a , ( 2 . 21 ) 6 where c ( x ) is some set of p - forms taking values in a g - module v and the 1 - form ω ( x ) = dx a ω a ( x ) is some fixed connection of g obeying the flatness_condition d ω + 1 2 [ ω , ∧ ω ] = 0 ( 2 . 22 ) ( [ , ] denotes the lie product in g ) , is invariant_under the global_symmetry g . eq . ( 2 . 19 ) provides a particular case of eq . ( 2 . 21 ) with g = sp ( 2m ) . the genera , tors of sp ( 2m ) can_be realized as bilinears built from oscillators y a i and yBRfreedom with larger energy is integrated_out . this implies treating the proton and muon in a non - relativistic fashion and integrating_out the pion and delta particles . this is achieved by matching hbet to nrqed . by integrating_out the scale m µ α , pnrqed is obtained and the potentials appear . schematically the path followed is the following ( ∆ ≡ m ∆ − mp ) : hbet ( m π , µ , ∆ ) = ⇒ nrqed ( m µ α ) = ⇒ pnrqed , and the resulting pnrqed lagrangian_reads lpnrqed = z d3rd3rdts † ( r , r , t ) ( i ∂ 0 − − v ( r , p , σ 1 , σ 2 ) + er · e ( r , t ) ) s ( r , r , t ) − z d3r p2 2mr 1 4 ( 3 ) f µ ν f µ ν , where s is the field representing the muonic_hydrogen , r the center of mass coordinate and r the relative distance . v stands_for the potential and admits an expansion in powers of 1BRpresence of antiferromagnetic_coupling with spin pinning / biasing or spin_canting at the interface regions [ 1 , 2 ] . further , the in - plane coercive_field ( hc ) is found to be 0 . 1 and 0 . 17 tesla , whereas the out - of - plane hc is 0 . 8 and 1 . 3 tesla for superlattices with n = 2 and 4 , respectively . the observed hc values of the superlattices are significantly_larger_than the hc 7 values of the sro ( hc ~ 0 . 07 and ~ 0 . 3 tesla along the in - plane and out -BR54 ) ( 55 ) thus one can obtain the energy and angular_momentum_per_unit_mass of the test particle along the circular_orbits : e2 0 = and , h ( r2 0 + q2 ) 2 − 2mr2 0 + q2 ) h ( r2 0pr2 0 + q2 ) 3 − 3mr4 ( r2 0pr2 0 + q2 + q2r2 0i2 0 + q2 + 2q2r4 0i .

( 57 ) circular_motion of the test particle to be exists for abg space - time when both energy and angular_momentum are real and finite . thus we_get the inequality : ( r2 0 + q2 ) 3 − 3mr4 0 + q2 + 2q2r4 0 > 0 0qr2 14 and r0 > qs2mpr2 mpr2 0 + q2 − q2 0 + q2 − q2 . circular_orbits do_not_exist for all values of r , so from eq .
