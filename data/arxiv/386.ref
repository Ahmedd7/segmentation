( 2012 ) proposed that the flare is related to the rapidly_changing shape of the bow_shock as the pulsar exits the be disc . the unshocked pulsar_wind becomes unconfined along the direction of weakest external_pressure , giving the cold pairs present in the wind more space ( and time ) to cool . a high_energy density of seed_photons with a favourable scattering geometry is still required : khangulyan et_al . ( 2012 ) postulated that this would_be provided by local heating of the be disc due_to the pulsar crossing . a possible clue is that the orbital_phase of the gev flare brackets inferior_conjunction of the pulsar ( τ + 60 d , fig . 1 ) . the observational_evidence presented above suggests the pulsar is away_from the be disc material , so that its ram_pressure balances the stellar_wind ram_pressure . in this case , the bow_shock is oriented_towards the observer at inferior_conjunction ( tam et_al . 2011 ) . for parameters appropriate to psr_b1259 - 63 , the wind momentum ratio η is UNK 103 km s − 1 UNK UNK 10 − 8 m UNK yr − 1 UNK UNK UNK η = e / c mwvw ≈ 0BR2 rin UNK r UNK r UNK r rin rin σ ( r ) = σ in z ( r ) = zin ω ( r ) = ω in UNK r UNK r rin UNK − c UNK − k , rin , cs ( r ) = cin , k ( r ) = kin ( a1 ) , ( a2 ) .
