[ 18 ] ) . our first goal is to give a formula for i α f as the conditional_expectation of a stochastic_integral . for this we follow the exact same approach as the one presented in [ 6 ] which represents the beurling - ahlfors operator as the projection of martingales with_respect_to space - time brownian_motion . for further examples of this technique , see [ 2 ] and [ 4 ] and the many references in these papers . probabilistic_approach to fractional_integrals and the hardy - littlewood - sobolev inequality9 4 . 1 . stochastic_integral representation for i α . let bt be brownian_motion in rd . for f ∈ s ( rd ) and fixed a > 0 , which we think of as being very_large , we consider the pair of martingales up to timeBR0 . 97 21 − 2 . 37 ± 0 . 94 20 − 4 . 81 ± 1 . 03 20 − 5 . 31 ± 1 . 06 20 − 5 . 42 ± 1 . 01 23 − 0 . 25 ± 0 . 18 23 − 0 . 66 ± 0 . 33 23 − 2 . 77 ± 0 . 69 6 − 2 . 94 ± 2 . 44 23 + 2 . 35 ± 0 . 45 19 + 2 . 95 ± 0 . 52 19 + 2 . 72 ± 0 . 51 22 + 1 . 31 ± 0 . 90 23 + 0 . 08 ± 0 . 40 19 + 0 . 89 ± 0 . 76 19 − 0 . 10 ± 0 . 59 18 − 0 . 58 ± 0 . 59 18 − 0 . 68 ± 0BRthe anderson model [ 25 ] . the sctl was naively applied to speckles in [ 24 ] assuming that the spectral function and the density of states are unaffected_by the disorder . the prediction of this ( onshell ) approximation is that the mobility_edge is always positive , see fig . 2 , and is obviously rather bad . a simple attempt to cure this problem is to incorporate in the sctl the real_part of the self - energy , which shifts the effective lower_bound of the spectrum to negative energies [ 28 ] . two variants of this simple idea have_been_used [ 15 , 16 ] , predicting that the mobility_edge of the blue speckle is actually negative . however we see in fig . 2 that these theories become rapidly inaccurate as the disorder_strength increases . first , they significantly_overestimate the correct position of the mobility_edge . second , in these theories the scattering_amplitude is still evaluated at the lowest ( i . e . second ) order in the born_approximation , making the mobility_edge dependent only on the correlation_function , eq . ( 2 ) , but not on the potential distribution , eq . ( 1 ) . as a consequence the sctl predicts identical mobility edges for blue and red speckles , whichBRdegree of node i . however , the estimator given by eq . ( 2 ) may be biased for directed_networks ( lu et_al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . therefore , to estimate pa without bias from an rds sample on a directed_network , we need to accurately calculate eq . ( 1 ) . because the stationary_distribution { π i } used in eq . ( 1 ) is analytically_intractable for most directed_networks , we will proceed by deriving estimators of it . 6 3 random_walks on directed_networks we consider a directed , unweighted , aperiodic , and strongly_connected network g with n vertices . let eij = 1 if there is a directed_edge_from i to j and 0 otherwise . an_undirected_edge exists between i and j if and only if eij = ejiBRimportant performance metric and argue_that a high value of spatial_reuse directly translates to high long - term network_throughput . we show that the proposed_algorithm has low computational_complexity and high spatial_reuse compared to existing_algorithms . the rest of the paper is organized_as_follows . in section ii , we describe our system model along with the physical and protocol interference models , discuss the limitations of graphbased scheduling_algorithms , formulate the problem and summarize the differences_between our work and existing work in sinr - based scheduling_algorithms . section_iii describes the proposed link scheduling_algorithm . the performance of our algorithm is evaluated in section_iv and its computational_complexity is derived in section v . we_conclude and suggest directions for future_work in section vi . ii . system model consider an stdma wireless_ad_hoc_network with n static nodes ( wireless routers ) in a two - dimensional plane . during a time_slot , a node can either transmit , receive or remain_idle . we assume homogeneous and backlogged nodes . let : ( xj , yj ) = cartesian_coordinates of jth node = : rj p = transmission_power of every node n0 = thermal_noise density d ( j , k ) = euclidean_distance_between nodes j and k we do_not consider fading and shadowing_effects . the received_signal_power at a distance d from the transmitter is given by p d α , where α is the path_loss factor . a link schedule effectively assigns sets of links to time_slots . specifically , a link schedule for the stdma network is denoted_by ψ ( c , s1 , ·_·_· , sc ) , where c = number of slots in the link schedule siBRacademic_databases for their research_activities , especially literature_review [ 6 ] . there are two major methods for conducting a literature_review or finding a research trend . the first method needs more effort and is more_time_consuming , it depends_on collecting , reading , summarizing of the available literature to find the trend of the research . the second method is based_on the academic_databases and in other_words is the process of statistically analyzing publications from several points of view , such as institution , authors , journals and monitoring keywords using the citation_indexing databases and academic_databases [ 7 ] . there are two methods for conducting a literature_review and finding the research trend . the firstBRout of the underlying graphene . the blue region highlights the root of the cnt originating_from graphene . the average diameter for this cnt is 26 . 8 ± 1 . 9 nm , b ) magnified , false colored image of the highlighted region in a ) . the blue_color indicates the cnt walls extending from the graphene support and the white color further highlights the root region . c ) high_magnification , false colored tem_image of a different cnt atop graphene . the yellow and purple colors highlight the cnt walls and hollow inner tube , respectively . the graphene planes within the yellow_region are parallel to the tube growth axis ( black_dashed
