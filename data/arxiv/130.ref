. this agreement is in itself not_surprising , since both approaches rely_on an empirical fit of sdss_galaxies . yet , we stress here that the ze_diagnostics have all been defined before_attempting any comparison with the standard diagnostic_diagrams . the agreement_between the ze_diagnostics and the kauffmann_et_al . ( 2003b ) diagnostic line is also a confirmation that overall , objects defined as h ii - like based_on the ze_diagnostics are indeed similar to starforming_galaxies classified using the standard line ratio diagram log [ n ii ] / h α vs . log [ o iii ] / h β . on the other_hand , the agn - like objects ( as defined by the ze_diagnostics ) can_be associated_with the “ traditional ” seyfert , liner and composite classes . from the distribution of uncertain galaxies in the middle_panel of figure 10 , it is clear that the ze_diagnostics are more consistent_with the kauffmann_et_al . ( 2003b ) diagnostic towards the locus of the sdss_galaxies . for log [ o iii ] / h β UNK 0 , the distribution of uncertain galaxies , which effectively trace the location of the boundary between h ii - like versus agn - like objects as defined by the ze_diagnostics , is not following the original diagnostic_lines . the scarcity of galaxies present in this area make it difficult to objectively decide which set of diagnostics may be more_appropriate , and further observations are required ( for example of very metal_poor galaxies ) . there is a smooth left to right gradient in the numberBR. 280901001101081091106 . 256 . 7513 . 0013 . 5014 . 0014 . 50 d ( å ) ( c ) o1 - fe1o1 - te3o1 - fe2angle ( deg ) ( d ) t ( k ) fe1 - o1 - fe2o1 - fe2 - o9o1 - fe1 - o3tn2tn1553025201510ftob ( a )  ( deg ) ftoc3025201510b - axisa - axisc - axisftocftocftoctn1 ( b ) lattice constant ( å ) t ( k ) tn2ftobftobftobte3 o9 o1 o7 o4 o2 o2 o7 o5 o3 o8 fe2 fe1 tems are thus expected to be comparable and should lead to similar magnetic orders . nevertheless , the difference in the interlayer_distance may significantly_influence the me coupling , as te4 + lone - pair electrons , which are involved in the fe - o - te - o - fe magnetic exchange pathway and most_probably carry the electric_polarization , 16 protrude into the interlayer space . 11 following , we summarize_our main_findings and discuss_how they comply_with the above assumptions . c c first , we stress that we find a finite ferroelectric_polarization and clear evidences of the me effect , in contrast to the prior far - infrared study18 that could not detect any link_between electrodynamic_response and magnetic_ordering . the observed dielectric_response may be explained in the following way . at tn 1 , small electric_dipoles develop along the c axis , inducing a concurrent step in  UNK c ( t ) [ fig . 8 ( b ) ] . however , since p ( t ) for ec is flat down to tn 2 [ fig . 8 ( a ) ] , theseBRa , vol . 59 , pp . 4249 – 4254 , jun 1999 .
