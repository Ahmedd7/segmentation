gamma - ray_telescopes have_been_able to put constraints on the energy scales of the lorentz - invariance violations ( liv ) . the crab_pulsar , the only pulsar detected at very_high energies ( vhe , e > 100_gev ) presents a unique_opportunity to put new constraints on liv . presented_here are the results of observations of the crab_pulsar with veritas and statistical_methods to determine limits of liv effects from energy - dependent timing differences . keywords_: crab_pulsar , lorentz_invariance violations , cherenkov_telescopes 1 introduction the crab_nebula is believed to be the remnant of a supernova observed in 1054 a . d . ; nine hundred and fourteen years_later , a high - e pulsar with a period of ∼ 33 ms was_discovered in the system [ 1 ] . all 117 known γ - ray_pulsars , including the crab , show a spectral cutoff above a few gev [ 2 ] . traditional pulsar models attribute this cutoff to curvature radiation originating within the magnetosphere . measuring the spectral_break energy and cutoff shape helps to constrain these models . magic ’_s observations of the crab_pulsar revealed significant pulsations at 25 gev with hints of signal at energies_higher_than 60 gev [ 3 ] . for the first time , the possibility existed of a non - exponential_cutoff in the spectrum of a pulsar . pulsed_emission was later detected by veritas above 120_gev , rejecting the exponential_cutoff model at the 5 . 6 σ level [ 4 ] ( see figure 1 ) . possible foamy nature of space - time , the speed of light in a vacuum could vary_depending_on the energy of a particle ( for a recent_review , see [ 5 ] ) . the energy scale forBR. , xt . then call t the running_time of the algorithm . iid the simplest algorithm for estimating p just fixes t = k , and sets pk = x1 + x2 + ·_·_· + xk k . in this case pk has a binomial_distribution with parameters k and p . the is close to p in the sense of having small relative_error , k should_be of the form standard_deviation of pk ispp ( 1 − p ) / k . therefore , to get an estimate which c / p ( for some constant c ) so that the standard_deviation is pp ( 1 − p ) / c and so roughly_proportional to p . from the central_limit_theorem , roughly 2 ǫ − 2 ln ( 2 / δ ) / p samples are necessary to get pk / p ∈ [ 1 − ǫ , 1 + ǫ ] for ǫ ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) . ( see section 3 for a more_detailed form of this argument . ) but p is unknown at the beginning of the algorithm ! dagum , karp , luby and ross [ 2 ] dealt_with this circularity problem with their stopping_rule algorithm .BR. fig . 8 . region of gluon momentum that is important in fig . 7 . low s high s boost boost y new fig . 9 . effect of boost on gluon in fig . 7 . section . in coordinate space , the cancellation is more_intuitive : these interactions happen outside past light - cone of the hard_scattering , i . e . , too_late to affect it . the cancellation only applies to the inclusive dy process : cross_sections in which requirements are imposed on the hadronic_final_state are a different matter6 . 3 . 4 . kinematic_region of gluons : 1 - loop paradigm extra terms that affect the tmd_factorization formula in qcd are illustrated by fig . 7 , which gives a one - gluon correction to the parton model . the relevant kinematic_range in the rapidity and the logarithmic transverse_momentum of the gluon is shown by the ( red ) horizontal_line in fig . 8 . the gluon approximately has the opposite transverse_momentum to the dy pair , and it is emitted essentially uniformly in rapidity , between kinematic limits . the dependence of the rapidity_range on qt is described by the triangle . both left - and right - moving gluons are included in the important range of momenta . to obtain factorization , the coupling of a gluon to an oppositely moving quark is converted to a wilson_line vertex in the operator definition of the tmd_parton density . an important_consequenceBRcurrent of mand element ( a ) : dependences of the applied_voltages to first and second inputs are shown in ( b ) ( top ) and ( bottom ) respectively . connected in serial , where the output is taken from a point between the two . to decouple the dividing element from the input / output parts of the circuit , the resistors may be connected through operational_amplifiers . experimental_data , showing the status of the output current when each or both inputs are activated , are shown in fig . 6 . when both inputs are activated , we see a gradual_increase of the output signal , while it_remains constant when only one of them is activated . this element performs a function similar to synaptic associative learning . reinforcement of the circuit demands the presence of both input_signals . when reinforcement occurs , the conductivity of the circuit in the case of each individual input is increased , but the application of a single input cannot reinforce the conductivity of the circuit . 8 erokhin , howard , adamatzky int jBR= ( f t + z ( 0 ) − mopt ) t q − 1 0 ( f t + z ( 0 ) − mopt ) . here mopt is defined as follows . let r = rankf t and u ∈ rn × ( n − r ) such that imu = ker f t and define mopt = u ( u t q − 1 0 u ) − 1u t q − 1 0 f t + . theorem 1 ( duality ) : let cu ∗ = ( ac , bc , cx , cu ) be the dynamic controller solving the dual control problem . let ( x ∗ , u ∗ ) be the corresponding solution of the optimal_control solution of the infinite time horizon observer design problem , and problem for x0 = ℓ . then bu ( t1 , s ) = u ∗ ( t1 − s ) is the σ ( bu , ℓ ) = j ( x ∗ , u ∗ ) = lim_sup z t1 ( u ∗ t ( t ) r − 1u ∗ ( t ) + x ∗ t ( t ) q − 1x ∗ ( t ) ) dt } . { x ∗ t ( t1 ) f ¯ q0f t x ∗ ( t1 ) + in addition , the dynamical observer o bu is of the form t1 →_∞ 0 c s ( t ) + ct s ( t )BRaccording_to equation 5 . 2 . to test the charge performance , we considered two scenarios ; the first is the standard double_chooz electronics and gain , with an rms_noise_level of 1 . 2 mv and a typical mean single_photoelectron amplitude of 35 mv , the second is with a factor of two higher gain and with a rms_noise_level of 3 mv . a fadc card is triggered by the pulse_generator each time the led illuminates . the mean number of photons_per shot is tuned so that all pulses are well - contained_within the 8 - bit range , and no signals are saturated . for each led setting , the dc offset (BR” mass for he - outbursts increases with decreasing maccr . this yields ∼ 10 he - flashes in the ∼ ( 106 − 107 ) yr before the amount of accreted_mass required to achieve he - ignition ( ∼ 0 . 1 ) m UNK becomes_larger_than the mass of the donor ( fig . 28 ) , while de_facto the binaries are already in the “ detonation ” regime of he - burning ( fig . 14 ) . thus , there must_be the “ last ” most_powerful outburst with an ignition mass of ∼ 0 . 1 m UNK which can occur in hydrodynamic_regime . it can lead to he - detonation which can_be potentially_observable asBR= √ k ( c ) mbo , e = 0 . 8 , a = − √ k ( d ) twe , e = 1 . 02 , a = − √ k fig . 17 . x − y plot for ω = 0 . 7 ( underrotating case ) , k = 1 . in the two plots ( a ) and ( b ) φ = − 1 and in the plots ( c ) and ( d ) φ = 1 . the solid circle_marks the horizon at x = r2 = 1 , the two dotted circles_mark the minimal and maximal values of the radial_coordinate . the dashed_circle is located_at the ‘ turnaround boundary ’ x ≡ r2 = 1 + ω e d τ . the orbit ( a ) is located_outside that circle . φ , signalling vanishing d ϕ we_now_turn to orbits in the overrotating case , ω > 1 .BReach successive cycle , at a given phase , is always_larger_than the previous_ones . observationally , we_already_saw on fig . 11 that these differences imply that the variations of pv and pbd will be of a smaller amplitude but it also results in a variation of these curves from cycle to cycle . this last points depends_on the parameters of the scenario and is mainly visible for low - period scenarios ( i . e . about a year or_less for α = 1 . 0 ) . this is well illustrated in fig . 12 : the loops in the pcd for a periodic scenario never close , and they are of a smaller amplitude than the loops for fully formed and dissipated disks in which they are confined . 3 . 3 . episodic_mass_loss rate the most_common type of variability observed in be stars is of an irregular nature , which means that the mass injection_rate varies with time in a complicated way . one extreme example are the so - called “ flickering activity ” , which is related to short - term variations seen in several observables . examples of flickering activity can_be found in rivinius_et_al .
