( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are equivalent to those obtained in the classical percolation model of the quantum_hall transition [ 47 , 48 ] and can_be expected for a critical 2d percolation on any lattice [ 38 – 40 , 42 – 44 ] . it is understood that quantum_tunnelling always plays_an_important_role at large_scales where a full quantum consideration is necessary . in our case such tunnelling is facilitated_by a finite v and a potentials , which drive our system in the thermodynamic_limit from the classical percolation regime [ eqs . ( 2 ) and ( 4 ) ] to the quantum_hall critical_point . this limit may not be of practical im4 portance though , since the size of samples in commensurate phase is technologically restricted to a few_microns . the conditions are hard to fulfil in an experiment which explains_why it is so difficult to observe insulating_behaviour in finite samples [ 12 ] . in conclusion , we present aBRschuppan - collected for the lift specification . the following lists one formula for the lift for three floors : g ( ( ( f0 - > ( !
