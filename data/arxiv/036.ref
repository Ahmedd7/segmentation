( 1 ) for_our_purposes , working under this assumption suffices for the analysis undertaken in this_paper . for a detailed_derivation of ( 1 ) consider ( thompson et_al . 1986 ) . the quantity v ( u , v ) is called the visibility function . the coordinates u and v are vector components describing the distance_between a pair of antennas in an interferometric array , where this distance is usually_referred to as a baseline . they are given in numbers of wavelengths , with u and v usually parallel to geographic east - west and north - south , respectively . the coordinates l and m are a measure of the angular_distance from the phase center along axes parallel to u and v , respectively . w ( u , v ) is a sampling function defined by article_number , page 2 of 13 UNK the layout of the interferometric array . it is zero throughout most of the u , v - space , apart_from where measurements_have_been_made where it is taken to be unity . the visibility function is what our instrument measures , but we are actually interested in the brightness_distribution of the source in the sky . unfortunately , an inversion of ( 1 ) gives_us not the true brightness_distribution , but its convolution with the inverse_fourier_transform of the sampling function , better known as the dirty beam idb = f − 1w : id = f − 1vBRof these techniques have not found their way into today_’ s dls . nearly all prototypes have_been discontinued . most ideas have_not_been evaluated more_than_once in a relatively_small study . the main question for us is : why have most of the results not_been adapted into today_’ s dls ? one simple answer could_be that this is typical in not all results of scientific_research are supposed to be commercially beneficial or adaptable in large_scale live environments . looking_at the different techniques and the studies that have_been_conducted we cannot say that the answer is that simple . taking a closer_look_at the results of the studies , we can see that usually quantitative results on the task performance and the accuracy of participants in a visual - based system are comparably poor or at_least equally_good as a strictly text - based system . on the other_side , in questionnaires , the participants ’ opinions on the same visual - based system wereBR/ haj1 ( ha ) + k UNK 1k2 − β 2 ) 1 / 2 and q = ( β 2 − n2 for an atom in the electronic_ground_state , the fictitious magnetic_field behaves in almost_every respect like a real magnetic_field [ 15 – 17 ] . in particular , both fictitious and real magnetic_fields are pseudo - vectors . thus , the fictitious magnetic_field bfict can_be vector - added to any static real magnetic_field b , such that the atom is in total exposed to the effective magnetic_field beff = bfict + b . this has_been_found in early_work by cohen - tannoudji and dupont - roc [ 15 ] , and further supported in various experiments , demonstrating , e . g . , optically_induced spin_precession in an atomic_beam [ 18 ] . based_on these_considerations and in analogy to the side - guide traps using current - carrying wires [ 19 – 21 ] , we_propose to create an optical wire trap for neutral_atoms . for this purpose , we apply a magnetic bias field bbias perpendicular to the axis of the nanofiber in fig . 1 . similar to conventional side - guide wire traps , low - fieldseeking atoms can_be confined in the ( x , y ) - plane around a line of minimalBR− h ¡ σ z 3k − 1 + s z 3k − 2 + σ z 3k ¢_¡ σ z 3k + 1 ¢ / 2i . s x 3k + s 3k − 2 σ z 3k − 1 3k − 1 + s z y 3k − 1 3k + 1 − h ¡ s z 3k − 1 3k σ z s z ( γ = x , y , z ) and σ z xk = 1hjh ∆ ¡ s x + k s z 3k − 1 γ here , the spin variables s k denote spatial components of the spin - 1 / 2 operators , the k parameter jh stands_for the xxz_heisenberg interaction_between the nearest - neighbouring heisenberg_spins and ∆ is an exchange_anisotropy in this interaction . the parameter ji denotes the ising_interaction between the heisenberg_spins and their nearest ising neighbours , while the parameter k describes the ising four - spin interaction_between both heisenberg_spins and two ising_spins of the diamond - shaped unit . finally , the last two terms determine the magnetostatic zeeman ’_s energy of the ising and heisenberg_spins placed in an_external_magnetic_field h oriented_along the z - axis . 3k − 2 + σ z 3k + 1 ¢ ( 2 . 1 ) figure 1 .
