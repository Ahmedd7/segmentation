ratio of the four complex_numbers representing its vertices in the prescribed order . using complex_numbers in the study of polygons has a long_tradition ( see , e . g . , [ 1 ] , [ 2 ] ) . we present several new_developments concerned_with the above notion of crossratio of quadrilateral . the main_aim of this_paper is to investigate the values of cross - ratio in certain families of planar quadrilaterals . two_types of such families are discussed : ( 1 ) the 1 - dimensional moduli_spaces of quadrilateral linkage [ 4 ] and ( 2 ) the 2 - dimensional moduli_spaces of planar robot_arms . in the first part of this_paper we deal_with quadrilateral linkages ( or 4bar mechanisms [ 7 ] ) . in spite of apparent_simplicity of these objects their study is related to several deep results of algebraic_geometry and function theory , in particular , to the theory of elliptic functions and poncelet porism [ 5 ] . comprehensive results on theBR, apjs , 36 , 241 ahn , c . p . , alexandroff , r . , allende_prieto , c . , 2012 , apjs , 203 , 13 badenes , c . &_maoz , d . , 2012 , apj , 749 , 11 bate , m . r . , bonnell , i . a . , &_bromm , v . , 2002 , mnras , 336 , 705 clark , b . m . , blake , c . h . , knapp , g . r . , et_al . 2012 , apj , 744 , 119 cui , x . -

m_´_ezard_conjecture are now standard [ 18 ] , we only emphasize how to modify kisin ’_s original proof in the cases that are not covered in [ 18 ] . let f be a totally_real_field in which p is split . let d be a quaternion_algebra with center f , ramified at all infinite_places and a set of finite places σ which does_not_contain the places above p . let u ⊂ ( d ⊗ f af f ) × be the open compact as in [ 18 , 2 . 1 . 1 ] . fix a continuous representation σ : u → aut ( qv w σ v ) such that w σBRdeg ( m ) ≤ w , etc . ) . we denote by der ( − log f ) the submodule of der ( − log d ) which annihilates f . because f is uniquely_determined_by χ up to a constant factor , the same_holds_true for der ( − log f ) . note_that ( 2 . 6 ) der ( − log d ) = ox χ ⊕ der ( − log f ) as ox - modules . indeed , for any δ ∈ der ( − log d ) , we have δ − a χ ∈ der ( − log f ) where a = δ ( f ) d · f ∈ c . 3 . lie_algebras of logarithmic derivations it is known [ sai80 , ( 1 . 5 ) ii ) ] that derx ( − log d ) is closed_under the bracket_operation [ − , − ] . in particular , χ acts_on derx ( − log d ) turning it into a graded ox - module . by ( 2 . 5 ) with g = f , the same applies to derx ( − log f ) . by the jacobi_identity we have ( 3 . 1 ) [ χ , [ δ , η ] ] = [ [ χ , δ ] , η ] + [ δ , [ χ , η ] ] deg ( [ δ , η ] ) = deg ( δ )BRlevel three demazure flag are related to partial theta_series . the paper is organized_as_follows . in section 2 , we recall the definitions and collect the necessary results from [ 5 , 10 , 15 ] on the relationship_between the g - stable level one demazure_modules and local_weyl_modules . in the next_section we restrict_our_attention to sl2 and recall the definition from [ 7 ] of the modules v ( ξ ) . we prove that these modules admit a demazure flag of level UNK for all UNK sufficiently_large . in the case when UNK = 2 we give a closed formula for the multiplicities . we then use results in [ 15 ] to give a character formula for the local weyl_module in terms of the demazure_module when g is of type bn . together_with the results of [ 13 ] we can give the character of the demazure_module for b1 n as a combination of macdonald_polynomials . in the last section , we define a directed , edge labeled , graph h UNK ( ξ ) and show that the multiplicity of a level UNK demazure_module in v ( ξ ) isBRthe word vector framework is in equation 1 , where h is constructed from w and d . the paragraph token can_be thought of as another word . it acts as a memory that remembers what is missing from the current context – or the topic of the paragraph . for this reason , we often call this model the distributed_memory model of paragraph vectors ( pv -
