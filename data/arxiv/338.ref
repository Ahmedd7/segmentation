edges are increased , both q and rd values decrease implying that the control parameter pc can_be used to generate communities with low or high inter - cluster edges which subsequently affects the q and rd values . figure 4 ( a , c ) are two sample networks ( network 5 and fig . 2 . different metrics calculated for the 32 generated graphs showing that the graphs are indeed small world and scale free .

there are_several_reasons_why it is not sensible to use a uniform criterion of 5 σ for all searches for new_physics . these include most of the features that we included as supporting the use of the 5 σ criterion . 3 . 1 lee this can vary enormously from search to search . some experiments are specifically_designed to measure one parameter , which is sensitive to new_physics , while_others use general_purpose detectors which can produce a whole_range of potentially_interesting results , and hence have a larger danger of a statistical_fluctuation somewhere in the background . an example of an experiment with an_enormous lee is the search for gravitational_waves ; these can have a variety of different signatures , occur at any time and with a wide_range of frequencies , durations , etc . it is illogical to penalise a single - measurement analysis simply because others have a significant lee . 3 search higgs search single top susy degree of surprise medium no_yes bs oscillations medium / low neutrino_oscillations medium bs → µBRδ ′ ≡ − δ / 2 , one should have δ ′ a0 + a1 = 0 ( γ − α − 2 ) ( α + 1 ) a0 + δ ′ a1 + a2 = 0 ( γ − α − 2 − 2p ) ( p + 1 ) ( p + α + 1 ) ap + δ ′ ap + 1 + ap + 2 = 0 or , in matrix notation , 5 δ ′ γ 1 0 0 . . . . . . 0 __________ 1 δ ′ γ 2 0 . . . . . . 0 0 1 δ ′ γ 3 0 . . . 0 0 0 1 δ ′ . . . . . . 0 . . . . . . 0 1 . . . γ p − 1 0 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . δ ′ γ p 0 0 0 0 . . . 1 δ ′ _______________ _____ a0 a1 a2 . . . . . . am − 1 am __________ = 0 from the above recurrence expressions , the function n , defined in eq . 13 , becomes a polynomial of degree n if and only if γ − α − 2 = 2n ; n = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . and an + 1 = 0 and so the γ p factors of the determinant are given by γ p = 2 ( n − p )
