transparent kerr_medium having a length l . in our discussion , the exact nature of this kerr_medium has only little importance : it can_be either a piece of bulk silica , a liquid_crystal layer or a photorefractive crystal [ 54 ] . the nonlinear effect under_consideration can_be either focusing or defocusing . the tranverse field incident onto the entrance side of the kerr_medium is a ( x , y , z = − l ) = ain ( x , y ) . the transverse field found at the output side of the kerr_medium is a ( x , y , z = 0 ) = a0 ( x ′ , y ′ ) ( see fig . 1 ) . let_us_consider that we_want to record the transverse far - field pattern of the field a0 ( x , y ) by using the standard and simple setup shown in fig . 1 . let_us_recall that the so - called far field n ( kx , ky ) is the spectral power density of a0 ( x , y ) . it is simply defined as where the transverse fourier_transform ( ft ) of the amplitude a0 ( x , y ) is defined by : n ( kx , ky ) = UNK UNK UNK fa0 UNK kx , ky UNK UNK UNK UNK 2 ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ft UNK a0 ( x , y ) UNK = fa0 ( kx , ky ) = z z + ¥ − ¥ a0 ( x , y ) e − i ( kxx + kyy ) dx_dy in order to measure the far - field pattern , the light beam_passes_throughBRthe gravitational_field : geometric proof s . masalovich technische_universit_ä_t m_ü_nchen , forschungsneutronenquelle heinz_maier - leibnitz ( frm_ii ) , lichtenbergstr . 1 , d - 85747_garching , germany e - mail_: sergey . masalovich @ frm2 . tum . de submitted to arxiv , april_2014_abstract an extraordinary focusing property of a parabolic_mirror for ultracold_neutrons in the presence of the gravitational_field was first reported by a . steyerl and co - authors . it was shown that all neutrons_emitted from the focus of the mirror will be reflected_back upon the same focus point passing , in between , a point of return in the gravitational_field . the present note offers a complementary geometric proof of this feature and discusses some implications . keywords_: ultracold_neutrons , gravitational_field , parabolic_mirror , neutron microscope . introduction in 1985 , the group of scientists led by a . steyerl at the technische_universit_ä_t m_ü_nchen reported successful_operation of a unique neutron microscope using ultracold_neutrons ( ucn ) [ 1 ] . the ability of such neutrons to reflect specularly from surfaces of many materials at any angle of incidence makes it possible , in principle , to use common optical schemes for designing a neutron reflecting microscope . however , unlike common optics , in ucn optics neutron trajectories are curved by the earth_’ s gravity . the curvature of every trajectory ( flight parabola ) depends_on the neutron velocity and the initial angle at an object thus resulting in appearance of considerable chromatic_aberrations . with the aim to correct these aberrations the authors developed the very_special twomirror optical system with a common vertical_axis . in this system neutrons first pass_through an object and move_downwards , then reflect upwards from a concave parabolic_mirror , pass the highest points ofBRrestriction_map ℓ ) ⊂ g ∨ s ( s ∨ ¯ ρ s , ℓ : ( π ∗ s ( s ∨ ) + g ∨ x , ℓ − r ) / g ∨ x , ( ℓ − r ) + → s ∨ / s ∨ ( ℓ − r ) + is given by the image of ad ∗ ( gx , ℓ ) ( β ) modulo g ∨ any representative of β ; x , ( ℓ − r ) + , where β ∈ g ∨ x , − r is ( 4 ) ifBR+ m 2 , − 1 ) + ( m ↔ − m ) ( b . 5 ) ( b . 6 ) references [ 1 ] n . gromov , v . kazakov and p . vieira , “ exact spectrum of anomalous_dimensions of planar n = 4 supersymmetric_yang - mills_theory , ” phys . rev . lett . 103 ( 2009 ) 131601 [ arxiv_: 0901 . 3753 [_hep - th ] ] . – 16 – [ 2 ] n . gromov , v . kazakov , s . leurent and d . volin , “ quantum spectral curve for ads5 / cf t4 , ” arxiv_: 1305 . 1939 [_hep - th ] .
