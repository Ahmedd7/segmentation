the energy_levels for the spectrum of h ( m1 , m2 ) ( 3 . 1 ) explicitly_depend_on the discrete parameters m1 and m2 . since the degree of the monomial φ n ( x ) ( 3 . 18 ) with n arranged in the form ( 3 . 31 ) is j = 1 pjgj + t , the energy eigenvalues ( 3 . 34 ) of h ( m1 , m2 ) given by n = 2ps can_be written_as i = 1 liki + 2pt sxi = 1 n = 2a es txj = 1 liki + 2a pjgj + at + e0 . ( 3 . 36 ) let_us_denote the numbers of the even and the odd components of n by n1 and n2 respectively , which can take all possible values ranging_from 0 to n , and satisfy the condition n1 + n2 = n . from eq . ( 3 . 31 ) it_follows that n1 = sxi = 1 ki , n2 = gj . txj = 1 thus we find that k ≡ { k1 , k2 , . . . , ks } ∈ pn1 and g ≡ { g1 , g2 , . . . , gt } ∈ pn2 , where pn1 and pn2 denote the sets of all ordered_partitions of n1 and n2 respectively . next , we sum_over the boltzmann_weights corresponding to all possible n in the ordered form ( 3 . 31 ) , by using the corresponding energy eigenvalues ( 3 . 36 )BRis coupled , the transition happens from a two - stage kondo state on the singlet side to an underscreened kondo state on the triplet side via a qcp of the same type as that of the 2ik model [ 68 ] . when two reservoirs couple to the quantum_dot , the transition from a spin zero system on the singlet side to a two - stage kondo system on the triplet side is a crossover , and the ground_state has fermi_liquid properties throughout [ 71 , 69 ] . this effect has_been_observed in lateral quantum_dots [ 72 , 73 ] and single_molecule transistors [ 65 ] . in the experiment by van_der_wiel et_al . [ 72 ] a lateral quantum_dot is tuned near a singlet - triplet degeneracy point using magnetic_field . conductance measurements show a dip in the zero - bias_anomaly at_low_temperatures , which disappears with increasing temperature ( fig . 6 ( b ) ) , as_well as the predicted logarithmic increase and decrease of the conductance with temperature and or bias ( fig . 6 ( c ) ) . however , in this system it is not possible to unambiguously distinguish_whether a singlet or triplet ground_state is responsible_for the observed effect . this makes it impossible to determine which of the twoBRthe inner_wall . 11 for this condition to be satisfied demands that the volume flux be continuous and always above some minimum value , which requires a large_amount of brine . some brinicles reach lengths of several metres and grow for several_hours or days . we can estimate how_much brine is required to grow such a brinicle . if we consider the brinicle to be a hollow cylindrical_shell , its mass is π ( r2 1 ) l ρ ice , where l is the length of the brinicle , r1 and r2 the inner and outer_radii and ρ ice the density of the ice . considering the latent_heat of fusion for water , l f = 333 . 7 j g − 1 , we can estimate how_much heat 2 − r2 it is necessary to absorb in order to freeze such a mass of ice . and we can consider how_much heat the brine is able_to absorb if we suppose that its specific_heat is similar to that of water ( cp ≈ 4 . 18 j g − 1k − 1 ) and that it is flowing_into a sea with a temperature difference of ∆ t ≈ 20 k . with such an estimation we calculate that the total volume of brine necessary to grow a brinicle of ∼ 1 m in length is ofBR5 . thoeretical dispersion index curve for both biological_skin ( solid_line ) and segelstein ’_s pure_liquid_water ( dashed_line ) . both curves were generated through the kramers - kronig_relation defining index as a function of absorption . inset focuses upon ir - vis - uv spectras . by inspection , the dispersion index for biological_skin is not strictly_greater_than pure_liquid_water . the prominence of the dispersion_curve around the thermal resonance verifies corollary 11 2 . 5 , also , dilation of the relaxation_time for bound water momentarily forces dispersion to dip slightly_below that of pure_liquid_water , circa 10 . 8 log10 (BRUNK 2 UNK ≤ exp UNK − γ 8 UNK . for γ ≥ 8 ln 1 µ , this is less_than µ . 8 we will generate some γ primes , of which ℓ primes p have cg ( p ) < t / 4 . in order to identify some primes p for which cg ( p ) is low , we have the following lemma . lemma 3 . 3 ( arnold et_al .
