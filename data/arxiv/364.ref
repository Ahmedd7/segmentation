UNK since the k - fold incentive process has the same stationary_distribution as the k = 1 case , and since the expected value functions agree at equilibrium via proposition 1 , we have the nextBRgraph corresponding to a doodle with n − 1 double points . thus we can draw a new doodle with at_most 2n − 2 inflection_points . then by returning_back the removed face we add no_more_than 2 inflection_points , see fig . 1 . contradiction with the minimality_assumption . figure 1 . returning the face of length 1 . counting the minimal number of inflections of a plane curve 3 b ) assuming that there_exists a face of length 2 , denote the vertices of this face by a , b , and its edges by l1 , l2 . vertices a and b are distinct , since otherwise this common vertex would have valency 4 , and therefore there_exist edges_joining this face with other vertices . but then our doodle has just one double point ; it is easy to check that this can not be a counterexample . remove edges l1 , l2 and contract a and b to one vertex calledBR1974 ) 32 – 57 [ 6 ] j . c . bezdek , “ pattern_recognition with fuzzy objective [ 7 ] j . c . bezdek , function algorithms ” , plenum , new_york , 1981 . in pattern classification ” , ph . d thesis , applied_mathematics centre , cornell_university , ithaca , 1973 “ fuzzy mathematics [ 8 ] j . yao , m . dash , s . t . tan , h . liu , ” entropy based fuzzy_clustering and fuzzy modeling ” , fuzzy_sets and systems , 113 , pp , 381 - 388 , 2000 [ 9 ] s . l . chiu ,BR( bec ) with optical_lattices using bosehubbard hamiltonian within ( ghfb ) approximation . the behavior of the depletion and the anomalous fraction has_been_investigated in the mott_insulator_phase . we found that at t = 0 , these_quantities become_significant in two and three_dimensions . it is shown also that the dimensionality of the lattice enhances the anomalous density . key_words : optical_lattice , bose - einstein_condensate , mott - insulator , fluctuations pacs : 32 . 80 . pj , 03 . 75 . fi , 71 . 35 . lk                                                                                                                         1 corresponding_author : e - mail_: a . boudjemaa @_univ - chlef . dz 1     1 . introduction : ultracold_atoms in optical_lattices have proven to be a rich field of investigation both_theoretically and experimentally . periodic_potentials are very well_known in solid_state_physics , where the basic description of the system is the bloch theory for a gas of noninteracting_particles , such as electrons in crystalline_solids . cold_atoms in optical_lattices have opened the possibility to investigate effects not previously observableBRs ) p ! a t − ! . . . a ( s ) a ( t ) a t − { z } p + 1 terms p UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK ≤ k δ p + 1 1 .
