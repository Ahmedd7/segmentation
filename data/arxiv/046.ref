[ 1 , 2 ] ) . for non - extremal_black_holes , one can similarly calculate the black_hole_entropy through a putative dual conformal_field_theory by imposing certain boundary_conditions on ( near ) the horizon and finding conformal_symmetries there ( see , e . g . [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 ] ) . all these works rely_on imposing extra conditions on a chosen boundary , but sometimes one can find more_than_one working boundary_conditions for a given background . on the other_hand , the dynamics governing the properties of a black_hole is unique . this raises the question of whether external information like an artificial boundary_condition is necessary in calculating the black_hole_entropy . in this respect , we have found previously that some conformal_symmetries actually emerge on the black_hole_horizons by themselves [ 7 ] .

UNK the sln_foam 2 - category 29 extending the above definition of degree to decorated foams by shifting the grading by the sum of the degrees of the decorations ( in the respective rings of symmetric functions , where the generators are of degree 2 ) , we see that the relations in ^ nfoamm ( n ) are degree - homogeneous , so this 2 - category is graded . we can now define the sln_foam 2 - category by_introducing a formal grading on 1 - morphisms and considering only degree - preserving 2 - morphisms . definition 3 . 5 . let nfoamm ( n ) be the 2 - category defined as follows : • objects are the same as in ^ nfoamm ( n ) . • 1 - morphisms are ( formally ) z - graded formal direct_sums of 1 - morphisms w in ^ nfoamm ( n ) . p α ifi − → qd2 w2 in ^ nfoamm ( n ) • 2 - morphisms are matrices_whose_entries_are 2 - morphisms qd1 w1 with deg fi = d2 − d1 for all i .BRfeature in the advanced_encryption_standard , and are useful for , among_other_things , constructing linear feedback shift_registers [ sch , chapter 16 ] . the integer analogy is finding large prime integers to use in some kind of cryptographic application , such as rsa . recall that the euler_totient_function is given by φ ( n ) = # { 1 ≤ k ≤ n : ( k , n ) = 1 } . lehmer_’ s totient problem ( also sometimes_called the carmichael conjecture ) asks_whether_there_exists an_integer n0 such that φ ( n ) = φ ( n0 ) implies n = n0 . ford [ fo1 ] proved that any such n0 must_be greater_than 101010 . the general strategy of proof ( first initiated by carmichael [ car ] ) is to construct two large set of primes p and p ′ such that every p in p or p ′ is a divisor of a potential n0 . if one could show the sets of primes p and p ′ to be infinite , it would follow that no such n0 exists ( see [ fo2 ] for more_details ) . these sets of primes both have the property that if p is in the set and r ( pBRs = 1 contribution which to first order in ∆ t is given by the second_term in the taylor_expansion 2 ∆ ϕ r2 z , and the expression for eout from ( 8 ) . adding up / integrating all these infinitesimal phase_shifts , with 2 ( r ∆ ϕ ) rz = 1 ∆ ( δ α ab ) = 0 , gives the result δ α ab = 0 in equation ( 10 ) i . e . the time - dependent part of the phase_shift cancels . the cancellation_between the electric and magnetic contributions to the phase in ( 11 ) is made more_transparent in the case when the flux varies_linearly as in ( 9 ) . in this case one can replace ∆ t by a finite time_interval t and the electric contribution in ( 11 ) takes the form − e  UNK r2 2 ρ ( b1t ) ( ρ ∆ ϕ ) UNK = − 6 e  UNK r2 ∆ ϕ 2 ( b1tBR{ { d , k , o } , { f , j , l } } ix = { { e , i , l } , { g , h , o } } , x = { { e , k , n } , { g , j , m } } the group sp4 ( z / 2 ) permutes these synthemes , and one verifies that in case d = 1 mod 2 , k = 0 mod 2 the matrix m induces the permutation ( i , iv , ii , iii ) ( v ii , x , ix , iiiv ) and n the permutation so that precisely syntheme v = { { b , l , n } , { c , d , g } } is preserved .
