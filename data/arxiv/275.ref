bayesian_approaches , but explicit consideration of this issue is lacking . the goal of this_paper is not to propose new methodology , but_rather to explicate the fundamental features of bayesian_estimation of causal_effects with propensity_scores in order to provide context for the existing_literature and for future_work on this important_topic . 2 estimation of causal_effects with propensity_scores here we_briefly_review estimation of causal_effects with propensity_scores . consider n observational units that have_been randomly_sampled from a population of interest . for each unit , we measure a continuous , categorical , ordinal , or timeto -

( 7 ) . since precise values of α ( e ) , β ( e ) , and γ ( e ) may actually be unknown , another_way without_recourse to them is preferable . we assume some model density distributions for protons and neutrons and calculate σ r values . if those cross_sections agree_with the measured_cross_sections simultaneously , rm ( n , z ) and δ ( n , z ) are calculated from the assumed distributionsBRas follows : s ω w . f . + ( x1 ⊥ , x3 ⊥ ) = dx1 − dx3 − ( x3 − − x1 − ) − 2 − ω tr [ x1 , x2 ] UNK .

( d . 2 ) this formula isBRfermions are non - trivially arranged in space [ 22 , 38 ] . most significantly , this pattern survives the random scattering process even after very long evolution times . while bosons have non - vanishing probability to be at the same site , fermions have zero probability to be at the same site , as expected due_to the pauli_exclusion_principle [ 17 , 37 ] . this profound difference_between the two quantum_walks is a signature of the probability_distribution sensitiveness to the initial_state , due_to the unitarity of the evolution . ii . static_disorder and anderson_localization let_us_now_move to the description of such a scenario in presence of disorder . disorder exists at different_levels in nature , ranging_from a few impurities or interstitial_defects in an otherwise perfect crystalline host [ 3 , 5 , 29 ] to the strongly_disordered limit of glass structures [ 23 ] . in particular , the static_disorder is set when a system parameter is a random_variable evolving in space but not in time [ 24 ] . such systems exhibit anderson_localization [ 3 ] . this phenomenon , has a fundamental relevance since it offers a mechanism to understand , for example , the electronic conductance in imperfect crystals and the metal - insulator_transition [ 5 , 23 , 29 ] . as predicted by anderson , static_disorder may_lead to the absence of diffusion and the particle wavefunction results localized . in one dimension , it can_be rigorously shown that all states are localized because of the repeated backscattering and the localization lenght is proportional to the mean free_path of the particle , no matter_how strong or weak the disorder is [ 29 ] . the key factor for the interference effect responsible_for the localization is
