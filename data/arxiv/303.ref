using only the first 0 . 8 μ s of the simulation and with a matrix of comparable size ( 10 , 000 × 10 , 000 ) . the result is that the molecular_dynamics trajectory corresponding to the lower ( red ) curve has_been sampled so much_more finely ( than the one - 6 corresponding to the upper curve ) , that successive structures are highly time - correlated . the resulting graph ( red_curve in fig . 1a ) brings this forward and clearly_indicates that for small values of the sampling factor the corresponding structures are not independent , and thus can not be used in good - turing statistics , with convergence being reached only much_later , for values of the sampling factor of ~ 30 . having obtained the distribution of ( maximum rmsds vs . sampling factors ) as shown in fig . 1a , the question_arises_how to accurately_determine for which value of the sampling factor convergence of the maximal rmsds is reached ( corresponding to the plateau of the graphs ) . once this value is known , the method is essentially complete : if , for example , we could determine that the optimal sampling factor is , say , 4 , then we would construct the four submatrices of dimensions [ ( n / 4 )BR2 ] h . spohn , rev . mod . phys . 53 , 569 ( 1980 ) .
