a function of the frequency of the vibronic_mode . one can see that with decreasing frequency , the efficiency starts to drop at approximately 16 mev . this drop can_be quite significant , up to 4 times at low_frequencies . we also show in this figure the efficiency value for case when there is no strong_coupling to the specific vibronic_mode which equals to 0 . 8314 for our set of parameters . for our_calculations , we use : the temperature t = 77 k , the light - bchl coupling_strength f = 10 − 4 mev 10 ( with the light coupled to the first pigment only ) , refraction_index nrefr = 1 . 42 , the heat_bath reorganization_energy λ ph = 4 . 34 mev , the reorganization_energy of the vibronic_mode λ vib = 18 . 6 mev , coupling to the reaction center gnk = 6 . 6 10 − 3 mev ( with only the third pigment coupled ) , and the coupling to the quenching field qm = 6 . 6 10 − 4 mev . to understand the physical reasons for such significant drop of the energy_transfer efficiency , we calculate the time dependence of the pigment populations with the results shown in fig . 4 ( a - f ) . for initial_conditions , we use the situation when the first pigment ( coupled to the light ) is populated and all other bchls are not . with no strong_coupling to the vibronic_mode ( fig . 4a ) , there are well - known quantum oscillations of populations of the first and second pigments ( for times of about 0BRis attained on ∂ g ′ . the same conclusion holds after letting ε , κ ↓ 0 and replacing g ′ with g ε 0 . hence , in g uk − v ≥ − sup g \ g ε 0 uk − v , which after letting ε 0 ↓ 0 and then k →_∞ yields v ≤ w . by comparing v with vk we_get v ≥ w , and hence uniqueness . to prove that w is a viscosity_solution we need a lemma , which is an elliptic analog of lemma 6 . 1 of [ 14 ] . introduce f0 ( uij , x ) = f ( uij , dw ( t , x ) , w ( t , x ) , x ) . lemma 5 . 1 . there is a constant n depending_only on d and δ such that d ( br ) ∩ c ( ¯ br ) we for any ball_br of radius r with closure in g and φ ∈ w 2 have on br that w ≤ φ + n rk ( f0 [ φ ] ) + kld ( br ) + max ∂ br w ≥ φ − n rk ( f0 [ φ ] ) − kld ( br ) − max ∂ br ( w − φ ) + .
