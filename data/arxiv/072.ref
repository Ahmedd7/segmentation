varying graphs have_been_extensively_studied time - aggregated communicafrom the perspective of tions between nodes during a particular time_interval ( leskovec , kleinberg , and faloutsos 2005 ) . using this representation , researchers have discovered structural patterns in graphs with long - lived links among the nodes ( e . g . , hub_nodes in the web ( barab_´_asi and albert 1999 ) ) . however , today , a wide_variety of electronic and online communication tools are producing streams of graph data . these streams are usually rapid , time - varying , unbounded sequences of short - lived links among the nodes ( e . g . , email , sms , tweets ) . since the interactions are indicators of hidden relationship structures among the individuals , there has_recently_been an interest in moving beyond the perspective of time - aggregated graphs to model and mine the dynamic structure of graph streams . the work in ( perra et_al . 2012 ) highlights the biases that result if time - aggregated representations are used to analyze dynamical_processes such as information / disease_spread , and discuss the importance of distinguishing_between the structural evolution and the dynamical process unfolding on top of its structure . alsoBRs exp l ≤ s exp in the componentwise order of vectors . this defines a partial_order relation on the set of path -

2d band_structure consisting of three hole_bands and associated fermi_surface ( fs ) columns . secondly an effective 2d rashba_spin_orbit_coupling term leads to a large splitting of the three bands which depends_on kz in such a way that overall 3d inversion_symmetry is restored . this has consequences for the possible superconducting pair states . due_to essentially decoupled layers it is reasonable to assume only intra - layer pairing . then one can expect features as in the non - centrosymmetric_superconductors consisting of a mixture of spin - singlet and triplet_pairing of the in - plane order parameter due_to lack of local 2d inversion_symmetry . for the overall 3d superconducting_state even or odd_parity classification is restored due_to the two_inequivalent sr -
