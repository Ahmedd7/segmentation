( 2012 ) . the fragmentation of granules is a article_number , page 4 of 12 continuous process , therefore , the distribution of granule sizes is also continuous , and it covers a fairly_large range . another_possibility to quantify the granule_size distribution is the area contribution function , which is given by fac = niai / atot , with ni being the number of elements within the areabin ai , and atot = UNK niai being the total area of all granules . the area contribution function is in principle a histogram of granule_size , which is weighted with the contribution of area to the total area ( roudier & muller 1986 ) . we noted_above that a linear granule_size is overestimating the histogram for smaller granules . the contribution function has the intrinsic advantage that a large number of small granules contributes only little to fac , since their area is small . it depicts the dominant granule_size , which contributes most to the radiation ( radiative_losses occur mostly from granules , which are hotter and have a larger area ) , independently of the linear or logarithmic bin_sizesBRmagnetic_field has_been measured toward w43 - mm1 ( mass - to - flux_ratio ∼ 2 , cortes et_al . 2010 ) , we also present a magnetic model taken from hennebelle_&_chabrier ( 2013 ) . for this model a magnetic_field of 20 µ g × ( nh2 / 103 cm − 3 ) 0 . 3 is assumed . these values are reasonable given what is known on the magnetic_field in this region ( cortes et_al . , 2010 ) . their exact choice , at this stage , is dictated_by the reasonable_agreement_with the data on the sfr . before comparing our results with the models , we_would_like to stress that all models have similar behaviors . indeed , for extremely cold_clouds ( i . e . have low α ) , most of the gas is gravitationally_unstable and therefore a significant_fraction of the density pdf contributes in the integration . since it is normalized by the total mass and mean freefall_time , the sfr tends_toward a constant value which is of the order of  . however , because the density pdf is weighted by the freefall_time which is shorter at high densities , the normalized sfr can_be larger_than  , here taken to be 30 % . for clouds which are more supported against gravity , only the densest_regions contribute to star_formation . thus only the high - density part of the pdf contributes . this leads to a sfr which can_be arbitrarily low and can have a stiff dependence on the cloud parameters . figure 5 displays our sfrff estimates against α vir along with the multi - freefall extrapolationBRl e r t s . t a m d n o c [ 2 v 6 3 6 1 . 7 0 3 1 : v i x r a 2 fig . 2 : ( color_online ) magnetization m vs internal field hi ( points ) , along with simulation ( lines ) ( see_text ) . corrections for demagnetizing effects were_made assuming a demagnetizing_factor n = 4 π / 3 ( cgs_units ) 33 . results for different sets of parameters ( assuming j4 = 0 ) are presented to illustrate the sensitivity of the calculation . inset : m vs hi for µ 0hi < 1 t at 100 ( green_squares ) , 200 ( blue_triangles ) and 500 mk ( red points ) . iii . xy anisotropy and crystal_field analysis aiming_at a
