( 72 ) ] is increased by an_additional order of magnitude . as a result of the measurement done at the end of each cycle , the error operator is projected to a state with well - defined stabilizer . this does_not make the error entirely classical as contributions from the error configurations differing by a product of some stabilizer_generators have to be added coherently ( these correspond_to all deformations of error chains with their ends fixed ) . note_that while the probabilities of various error configurations are , as usual , proportional to the magnitude squared of their amplitudes , a typical outcome will have an error - covered fraction scalingBR= Œ∂ e ( s ) le ( Œ∑ ‚àí 1 œÉ ( Œ∑ ) , s ) ll ( Œ∑ ‚àí 1 l œÉ ( Œ∑ l ) , s ) references [ agrs ] a . aizenbud , d . gourevitch , s . rallis , g . schiffmann , multiplicity one theorems . ann . of math .
