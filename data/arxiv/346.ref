slidar ’_s contribution as a new c2 n profiler and we suggest some improvements . this_paper is organized_as_follows . in section 2 , we recall co - slidar ’_s principle and formalism and we describe the improvements on the reconstruction . in section 3 we show the latest performance of the co - slidar in a simulated case . section 4 is dedicated to the on - sky experiment and results . in section 5 we discuss co - slidar ’_s contribution in the c2 n profilers ’ landscape . our_conclusions and perspectives are given in section 6 . 2 . co - slidar ’_s principle and formalism co - slidar is based_on correlations of slopes and correlations of scintillation measured with a sh on a binary star . in subsection 2 . 1 , we first recall co - slidar ’_s principle and theory . we present the direct problem in subsection 2 . 2 . in subsection 2 . 3 , we describe the maximum_likelihood inversion together_with the debiasing process and we detail the computation of the error_bars . in subsection 2 . 4 we present the maximum a posteriori inversion . finally , in subsectionBRsmaller first and 99th percentiles ( n1 ≈ 1 · 10 − 4 s − 1 and n99 ≈ 2 · 10 − 3 s − 1 ) than at mooring 1 . at mooring 2 , n - distribution also has a broader peak than at mooring 1 ( see figure 2 - d ) , but higher values of n are markedly less_frequent , with a very_short right tail of the distribution . all the statistics of n are computed excluding the values of the top and bottom thermistors , since the value of n is less_reliable there , being computed_using backward / forward differences instead of centered ones . figures 2 - b , d suggest that the vertical resolution of the two moorings imposes a cutoff to the highest values of n , in particular in mooring 2 , having a vertical resolution of 1 m , to be compared with the 0 . 7 m of mooring 1 . the presence of this cutoff is , however , less_evident than for lt in figure 2 - a . this cutoff is a consequence of resolving only a small_portion of the temperature variance turbulent_cascade , an unavoidable limitation of these kind of measurements , shared by all but the highest_resolution temperature measurements in the ocean . to further check the results from the thermistors , n is computed within 2 m -
