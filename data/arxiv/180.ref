final integrated magnitudes . as for the 1 σ dispersion around the mean magnitudes , it is generally only slightly_reduced in case of the smooth tracks , for simulations up to 100 agb_stars . the reduction of the dispersion is enhanced when the agb contribution peaks . to give more_quantitative estimates of the maximum expected reduction , populations of 1000 , 100 and 10 objects display 1 σ dispersions equal to ∼ 0 . 03 , 0 . 10 and 0 . 30 mag for log ( t ) ∼ 9 . 0 , respectively , but almost independent of age and z . these are reduced by ∼ 0 . 02 and ∼ 0 . 05 - 0 . 10 mag for the case of 100 and 10 agb_stars respectively , when smooth models are employed . we_conclude this section by comparing selected integrated optical and ir colours we obtained with wf09 calculations for both agb and pre - agb phases ( we display the full set of mc_simulations with 1000 stars for eachBRof client type and network delay on the desired control interval ( 0 . 003s ) . figure_9a is was measured for the javascript_client running on arima 9b is for the python client running on diego connected via a vpn from off - campus . the timing challenges of using javascript at this frequency has_already_been stated . neither the browser , nor the scripting_language was_designed to operate in this manner , and it is clear when_one_considers the wide distribution of control intervals associated_with 3ms intervals ( see 9a ) . design notwithstanding , this histogram shows support for avoiding control with time_intervals on the order fractions of seconds . this guideline should_be reconsidered within 2 years , as modern browsers are transitioning to different interaction paradigms and implmentations . considering the histogram for control intervals to an off - campus controller ( fig . 9b ) , the impact of transmission_delay at minimum on the order of 40ms is evident . as previously indicated , the increased transmission time results in more zero - length intervals and although not even the target sampling_rate is evident , control is still able_to be stably demonstrated in the system . 9 5 conclusion from these results we can conclude_that relevant control can_be performed at operating frequencies meaningful in robotics . further study is needed with systems that are unstable to characterize the opportunities for other relevant classes of robotic_systems . this_work shows that by leveraging resources and standards long pervasive in networked_control environments , that exciting_opportunities to connect to high - level distributed control systems , with little additional investment by research - ers and developers . web standards and browser standards areBRfor any n ≥ n . proof of proposition 6 . 3 . let ξ ∈ h 1 be arbitrary . by the definition of a θ [ ξ ] in ( 6 . 4 ) , and the fact that r ⊥ θ is divergence - free , we have zt2 λ 2 ξ a θ [ ξ ] dx = − κ k ξ k2 ≤ − κ k ξ k2 h 3 / 2 + UNK UNK UNK UNK zt2 ∂ kr ⊥ θ · ∇ ξ ∂ k ξ dx UNK UNK UNK UNK + UNK UNK UNK UNK zt2 ∂ k ( r ⊥ ξ · ∇ θ ) ∂ k ξ dx UNK UNK UNK UNK h 3 / 2 + ck θ kh 3 / 2k ξ kh 3 / 2 k ξ kh 1 + ck ξ kh 1 / 2k θ kh 2k ξ kh 3 / 2 . here we have appealed to the sobolev_embedding h 1 / 2 ⊂ l4 . using the poincar_´_e_inequality it_follows that zt2 λ 2 ξ a θ [ ξ ] dx ≤ − κ 2 k ξ k2 h 3 / 2 + c10 κ k θ k2 h 2k ξ k2 h 1 .
