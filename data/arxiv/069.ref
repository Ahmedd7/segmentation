for a case when the first of the produced x8 / 3 decays via contact_interaction , and the second via charge 5 / 3 ( for the latter_case we take the average of the efficiencies of the first two cases ) . the relevant acceptances are presented in table_ii . the efficiency of the cuts for charge 5 / 3 and − 1 / 3 states are very_close to each_other due_to the similar topology of their decays [ 16 ] , but the contribution of the latter is suppressed by the br into 2ssl . consequently , the full signal is mostly determined_by the charge 5 / 3 and 8 / 3 states and therefore depends_on the single parameter m defining their masses . using current data , we obtain a lower_bound m ≥ 990 gev @ 95_% c . l . ( iii . 17 ) which is marginally stronger_than the bound obtained assuming that only the x8 / 3 is present ( eq . ( ii . 3 ) ) . furthermore , given that for moderate_values of m , the experimental sensitivity to contact_interactions and to the 5 / 3 - mediated ones are comparable , we_conclude that the constraint on m obtained in section ii for the x8 / 3 alone , is independent of the details of the model and that the bound obtained by considering x8 / 3 going toBR( λ + 5 ) 6 λ 3 + 101 λ 2 + 576 λ + 1084 ( λ + 3 ) 3 λ 3 + 49 λ 2 + 252 λ + 428 UNK UNK 11 λ 4 + 243 λ 3 + 2124 λ 2 + 8424 λ + 12456 17 λ 4 + 378 λ 3 + 3221 λ 2 + 12396 λ + 17876 ( λ + 4 ) ( λ + 5 ) ( λ + 6 ) 2 UNK UNK UNK ( b . 14 ) ( λ + 3 ) UNK 243 λ 7 + 11043 λ 6 + 224709 λ 5 + 2623025 λ 4 + 18820392 λ 3 + 82210172 λ 2 + 199702896 λ + 205364480 UNK p ( 4 ) p ( 4 ) p ( 4 ) 0 , 3 ( λ ) = p ( 4 ) 0 , 4 ( λ ) = p ( 4 ) 0 , 0 ( λ ) = 1536 49152 0 , 1 ( λ ) = − ( λ + 3 ) UNK 27 λ 6 +BRc . if verifiers verify the position of p by performing this scheme n time successively , p is identified and his position is authenticated . in this scheme , no secret_information is sent publically without properly encoding . the encoded message can only be decoded by p having secret 2 - bits . 5 . 2 . qpv scheme - b this scheme is shown in figure 4 and follows : 1 ) . v0 possesses an entangled_qubit pair ( 1 , 2 ) in bell_state 11 and also shares an entangled_qubit pair ( 3 , 4 ) , in bell_state 01 , with the prover p . v1 also possesses an entangled_qubit pair ( 11 , 12 ) in bell_state 11 and shares an entangled_qubit pair ( 9 , 10 ) , in bell_state 01 , with the prover p . the prover p possesses two entangled_qubit pairs ( 5 , 6 ) and ( 7 , 8 ) both inBRx ] denote the operation of rounding to the nearest_integer . then the number of derangements of k elements is given by dk = [ n ! / e ] . under the hamming_distance defined in ( 1 ) , a sphere of radius r has volume v ( n , r ) def = r ∑ k = 0 UNK n k UNK dk the gibert - varshamov_bound [ 19 , 27 ] and the sphere - packing bound [ 22 ] now give the following . theorem 1 . n ! v ( n , d − 1 ) 6 m ( n , d ) 6 n ! v UNK n , ⌊ d − 1 2 ⌋ UNK ( 2 ) the gilbert - varshamov_bound is used_extensively in coding_theory [ 22 , 25 ] . as is well_known , improving this bound asymptotically is a difficult_task [ 25 ] . recently , gao , yang , and ge [ 18 ] showed_that the gilbertvarshamov bound in ( 2 ) can_be improved by a factor ω ( log n ) , when d is fixed and n →_∞ . in this_paper , we complement this_work , focusing_on the more natural case where d / n is a fixed ratio and n tends_to infinity . our_main theorem is the following . theorem 2 . letd / n beafixedratiowith 0 < d / n < 0 . 5 . then as n →_∞ , wehave ( 1BRshows that qj has three components , due_to different physical_processes . the contributions of each one is discussed in § 4 . 5 . 2 , and the related magnetization induced resistivity is discussed in § 4 . 5 . 3 . – 12 – 4 . 5 . 1 . convection vs . static_electric_field driven joule_heating let qj , m be the maximum_value of qj for a given sheet . it is found that for all solutions the ratio vzbx / cey ∼ 10 − 4 − 10 − 1 in the region where qj ≥ 10 − 2qj , m , and is ∼ 10 − 3 − 10 − 1 in the region where qj ≥ 10 − 1qj , m . for all sheets , the smallest values of the ratio are in the regions where qj is a maximum . then it is ey thatBRs . j . clark , m . d . segall , c . j . pickard , p . j . hasnip , m . i . j . probert , k . refson , m . c . payne , z . kristallogr . 220 ( 2005 ) 567 – 570 .
