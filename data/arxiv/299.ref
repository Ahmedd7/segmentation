[ 3 ] . it was shown that an amplitude of the annual_variation does_not exceeds of 6 . 1 × 10 − 5 ( 95_% c . l . ) . variations of an activity with periods less then one year were_excluded at the level of 4 × 10 − 5 during the measurement of the 232th activity in the ref . [ 3 ] too . a count_rate of the detector recording the source radiation was a subject of investigations in the all mentioned works . a high sensitivity of the measurements was reached by using of a relatively_high count_rate ( ∼ 103 s − 1 ) , of a control and a stabilization of conditions of the measurements and by an use of additional arrangements for a shield of the set - ups against of outer background . the reached limitations are multiply exceed amplitude values of ∼ 1 . 5 × 10 − 3 of the 32si and 226ra count_rates of annual variations discussed in the work [ 4 ]BR3 δ v mol α β . α β , 2 δ v mol methods in order to solve the hamiltonian in eq . ( 5 ) with the above parameters , we use dynamical mean_field theory ( dmft ) [ 26 ] . the dmft equations are solved with an exact - diagonalization ( ed ) impurity_solver [ 27 ] , and some of the results are cross - checked using a continuous time quantum_monte_carlo ( ctqmc ) solver [ 28 ] . dmft maps the hubbard - holstein lattice problem ( 5 ) onto an andersonholstein impurity model ( ahim ) [ 29 ] with a self - consistently defined bath . in order to solve this impurity problem using the lanczos_method we have to truncate the hilbert_space by limiting the number of bath levels nbath ( here 9 ) and the maximum number of excited phonons ( here we use 20 ) . we have therefore a three - orbital impurity whose local non - interacting hamiltonian contains the ep - dc correction α β . the impurity is hybridized with nbath bath levels with energy ǫ l , and coupled to an onsite harmonic_oscillator . c αBRthe next lemma . lemma 5 . the block structure of a weighing matrix can_be determined in o ( n3 ) . proof . given a weighing matrix w of order n , let g be the graph on n vertices with an edge between i and j if and only if at_least_one nonzero_entry in row i is in the same column as a nonzero_entry in row j . two rows of w are in the same non - decomposable block if and only if there is a path between the corresponding nodes in g . thus , a non - decomposable block of w can_be found by taking the rows corresponding to all vertices in any connected_component of g and removing any columns that only have zeroes . the number of non - decomposable blocks of w is the number of connected_components of g . by placing the number of vertices in each 3 non - decomposable block into a list and sorting that list ( say we now have n1 , n2 , ·_·_· , nk ) , we have that the block structure of w is jn1 ⊕ jn2 ⊕ ·_·_· ⊕ jnk . this process has three steps : first , we must build the graph . this can_be done in o ( n3 ) by looking_at all pairs of rows and examining each column . then ,BRbased_on the structures measured at 2 k4 and used the experimental unit_cell parameters . all relaxations were done in a collinear spin - polarized calculation with magnetic propagation vector ( 1 / 2 0 0 ) ( for the conventional_unit_cell ) . allowing the ionic_positions in the supercell without the muon to relax from the experimentally known positions yields negligible relaxation ( < 0 . 1 a ) . for the relaxed supercell , the lowdin analysis yields a cu2 + moment of 0 . 56 µ b while the integrated absolute magnetisation of one supercell is 9 . 1 µ b ( containing 8 cu2 + ions ) . given the difficulties in calculating absolute magnetic_moments accurately by projecting_onto atomic_orbitals ( such as in a lowdin analysis ) , we_conclude that the dft predicts a full cu2 + moment of 1 µ b in the unperturbed system . if there is any polarised spin density ρ ( r µ ) at the muon_site there is a fermi contact_interaction a = 2 µ 0 3 γ e γ n ρ ( r µ ) , ( 1 ) where γ µ is the muon gyromagnetic_ratio and γ e is the electron gyromagnetic_ratio . the contact hyperfine_couplings were_calculated using the projector_augmented_wave ( paw ) method5 as implemented in the gipaw package1 and used norm - conserving data_sets with wavefunctionBR. 3 ( а , b ) , in the case of the small size dust fraction in the absorber in the horizontal iaf , there are the maxima of the small_dispersive_coal_dust_particles masses concentration density in the granular_filtering_medium with cylindrical_coal_granules , which are positioned on the distances of 3 cm – for the 4th layer , 8 cm for the 1st , 3rd and 4th layers ; 16 cm – for the 2nd and 4th layers . this is a main distinction of the horizontal iaf from the vertical_iaf . this type of the maxima of the small_dispersive_coal_dust_particles masses concentration density was early observed in the vertical_iaf , when the big size dust fraction propagated in the vertical_iaf ( curve 2 in fig . 3 ( b ) ) . according_to the diffusion model in [ 3 ] , in the case of the considered dependences of the small particles masses concentration density on the distance x along the length of absorber in the iaf , it is possible to introduce the general formula to describe a main peak of the small_dispersive_coal_dust_particles masses concentration density , which appears due the process of structurization of the small_dispersive_coal_dust_particles of various_sizes in a close_proximity to theBRprediction in an environmental wsn . individual wireless_sensor_nodes are used to measure specific characteristics of an object or environment . these measurements are gathered and stored on the smartphone from each_node in the network in real time after successfully creating a tcp_connection with a wsn base_station . as data is retrieved and stored , the system applies dmml algorithms important attributes and correlations from the data . these are then used to build learning models for each sensor and each_node . the models are then used for node classification and the prediction of values for each sensor . smart then looks for faulty classified nodes to extract and large_deviations between predicted and actual values . if the later value is greater_than the specified percentage threshold and all other values lie_within the threshold , we mark the outlier sensor metric as faulty .BRof UNK β − i ) . defining ei = yi − yi and σ = x UNK x UNK UNK UNK x UNK y − x UNK UNK i σ − 1 xi σ − 1xy − xi σ − 1x UNK UNK UNK yi − liyi 1 − li ei 1 − li − UNK − 1 UNK x UNK y − x UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK β − i = UNK σ − x UNK UNK = UNK β − σ − 1x UNK = UNK β − σ − 1x UNK = UNK β − σ − 1x UNK = UNK β − i xi σ − 1xix UNK 1 − li yi + yi ( 1 − li ) 1 −BR, σ and ir , σ , projected into the finite liouville - fock_space for bheff . these processes can_be systematically taken_into_account , using the explicit_expression of the current vertecies . these additional contributions to the diagonal_components , for the current from the left lead , are given by ( 72 ) − ∞ v2 l d ǫ 2 π esll ( ω ) = sll ( ω ) + δ sll , δ sll = x σ z ∞ × h g + − ev →_∞ − − − − − → l ( ǫ ) g + − 8 γ l γ r γ l + γ r l ( ǫ ) g − + + g − + . 0 , σ ( ǫ
