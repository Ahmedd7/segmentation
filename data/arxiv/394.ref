of - plane coupling interface_between light and on - chip components [ 2 ] . however , the small size of the slot and high reflectivity from metal_layers of the plasmonic slot_waveguides make it very_difficult to achieve_good coupling_efficiencies . several techniques were proposed to increase the coupling efficiency using , e . g . , specially_designed ultrasmall plasmonic_nanoantennas [ 3 – 5 ] . however , the practical value of the demonstrated improvements is decreased by inevitable propagation_losses in the metal_layers of the plasmonic slot_waveguides . furthermore , a coupler that consists of several parts increases the footprint of the device , which is highly_undesirable . low - loss dielectric slot_waveguides are reliable substitutes for the plasmonic slot_waveguides [ 6 ] . such waveguides consist of a thin low - index slot embedded between two high - index bars . to fulfil the continuity condition of the normal electric_displacement , a high - field concentration exists in the low - index region . for this reason the dielectric and metal slot_waveguides work for the fig . 1 . broadband coupling of light from free space to an on - chip dielectric slot_waveguide by means of a tapered plasmonic nanoantenna . light can_be focused either using a lens ( shown_schematically ) or a lensed optical_fibre . both nanoantenna and waveguide are placed on a dielectric_substrate with low refractive_index ns = 1 .BR, m ___________ for k = 1 , . . . , p $ zi , n + 1 = zi , n + ε i , n UNK qi ( x1 , n , . . . , xm , n , y1 , n , . . . , yp , n ) + ci , n − zi , n UNK xi , n + 1 = xi , n + ε i , n µ n UNK j γ ai ( 2zi , n + 1 − xi , n ) + ai , n − zi , n + 1 UNK $ wk , n + 1 = wk , n + ε m + k , n UNK qm + k ( x1 , n , . . . , xm , n , y1 , n , . . . , yp , n ) + dk , n − wk , n UNK yk , n + 1 = yk , n + ε m + k , n µ n UNK j γ bk ( 2wk , n + 1 − yk , n ) + bk , n − wk , n + 1 UNK , ( 5 . 18 ) and set ( ∀ n ∈ n ) yn = σ ( xj , yj ) 06j6n and en = σ ( ε n ) . in addition , assume_that the following hold : ( ii ) for every n ∈ n , en and yn are independent . p [ ε 0BR. the imprint of such mechanism results in the so -
