[ 2 ] t .BRand star_formation . we then synthesize a comprehensive physical_picture that arises_from the confrontation of these observations and simulations . 1 . introduction the physics controlling the earliest_phases of star_formation is not_yet_well_understood . improving our global understanding of these phases is crucial for gaining_insight_into the general inefficiency of the star_formation process , the global rate of star_formation on_galactic_scales , the origin of stellar_masses , and the birth of planetary_systems . since ppv seven years_ago , one area that has seen the most_dramatic advances has_been the characterization of the link_between star_formation and the structure of the cold interstellar_medium ( ism ) . in particular , extensive_studies of the nearest star - forming_clouds of our galaxy with the herschel_space_observatory have provided us with unprecedented images of the initial and boundary_conditions of the star_formation process ( e . g . , fig . 1 ) . the herschel images reveal an intricate network of filamentary_structures in every interstellar_cloud . the observed filaments share_common properties , such as their central widths , but only the densest filaments contain prestellar_cores , the seeds of future stars . overall , the herschel data , as_well as other observations from , e . g . , near - ir extinction studies , favor a scenario in which interstellar filaments and prestellar_cores represent two key steps in the star_formation process . first large - scale supersonic_flows compress the gas , giving_rise_to a universal web - like filamentary_structure in the ism . next , gravity takes over and controls the further fragmentation of filaments into prestellar_cores and ultimately protostars . the new observational_results connect remarkably_well with nearly a decade ’_s worth of numerical_simulations and theory that haveBR+ κ 2s2 = 0 , with κ i ∈ k , i = 1 , 2 , and at_least_one of the κ i 6 = 0 . since k is the fraction field of a , we can assume_that κ i ∈ b , i = 1 , 2 . this relation induces a relation in m ⊗ b b / f . since s1 and s2 are_linearly_independent in m ⊗ b b / f , f must divide both κ 1 and κ 2 . substituting κ i with κ i / f ( i = 1 , 2 ) , we obtain a new relation κ 1s1 + κ 2s2 = 0 , with ki ∈ b , i = 1 , 2 . since we can repeat this process infinitely_many_times , this implies that each κ i is infinitely_divisible by f . since f is not a unit and at_least_one of the κ i is non - zero , this is a contradiction . the second_step is to restrict to a , and use induction . we have the short_exact_sequence 0 → ox ( − a ) → ox → oa → 0 . tensoring with ox ( md ) with get let km be the kernel of ox ( md ) → ox ( md ) UNK UNK a , so that we have the short_exact_sequence ox ( md − a ) → ox ( md ) → ox ( md ) UNK UNK a → 0BR18 ms . there are also part of smbs which can_be detected with obviously frequency drifting rates , and the value is in the range of 1400 - 8800 mhz / s . table 2 lists the averaged burst strength , lifefrequency bandwidth , and the frequency time , drifting rate of smbs associated to the x7 . 1 flare event . 2 . 3 . 3 . sporadic smbs in some flares besides the above two smb abundant flares , there are additional 4 flares having sporadic smbs , including e1 ( x1 . 2 flare , duration of 40 min ) , e10 ( m6 . 7 flare , duration of 57 min ) , e11 ( x1 . 3 flare , duration of 37 min ) , and e12 ( c4 . 8 flare , duration of 15 min ) in active_region noaa10720 . table fig . 6 . — two segment spectrograms of smbs at lcp and rcp observed by sbrs / huairou in the decay phase and after the ending of the x7 . 1 flare ( e13 ) on 2005 - 01 - 20 .BRa ) intensity [ counts / 150 s ] t = 1 . 81 kp = 0 . 00 kbar050100150200250300 ( b ) intensity [ counts / 150 s ] t = 1 . 81 kp = 1 . 05 kbar050100150200250300 ( c ) energy_transfer [ mev ] intensity [ counts / 150 s ] t = 1 . 81 kp = 1 . 75 kbar0 . 40 . 60 . 811 . 21 . 41 . 61 . 8050100150200250300energy transfer [ mev ] ( d ) t = 3 . 88 kp = 1 . 75 kbar0 . 40 . 60 . 811 . 21 . 41 . 61 . 8 ( e ) t = 5 .BR2521 – 2533 , 2006 .
