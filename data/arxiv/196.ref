( when we calculate dynamics for strong_interactions , we modify these wavefunctions according_to ref . [ 33 ] . ) during the ramsey dark time , the even relative coordinate modes acquire energies given by ∆ es (BRg = m ( s / 2 , q ) . then the g ( ∞ 01 ) - orbit in v containing 1d is the set { 1d σ si 0 ≤ i < s ( d ) / s } of size s ( d ) / s . if g = pgl ( 2 , q ) · h σ si , then the g ( ∞ 0 ) - orbit ∆ ( ∞ 0 ) containing 1d consists of the ( q − 1 ) s ( d ) / s pairs ab , where a ∈ gf ( q ) \_{ 0 } and b = ad σ si with 0 ≤ i < s ( d ) / s . the orbit ∆ ( ∞ 0 ) is self - paired because the element t1 , − d , 1 , − 1 interchanges ∞ 0 and 1d . if g = m ( s / 2 , q ) , then the g ( ∞ 0 ) - orbit ∆ ′ ( ∞ 0 ) containing 1d consists of the ( q − 1 ) s ( d ) / s pairs ab , where bBR, and the hybrid terms − → π ( 2 ) , ( 0 , 0 , ~ 0 ) ( 5 . 4 ) a , r , iii ( f , g ) ( x ) : = { xr ∈ r , i , j ≤ 1 , cr r 1 2 i ⊆ 5i0 , j ⊆ ( 5j0 ) c ( 5 . 5 ) − → π ( 2 ) , ( 0 , 0 , ~ 0 ) a , r , iv ( f , g ) ( x ) : = { xr ∈ r , i , j ≤ 1BRfor the fishnet metamaterial at three different_wavelengths λ : effective_refractive_index neff , propagation constant β , spm coefficient normalized to its bulk value . glass under the condition of the same optical power flow . the results are_summarized in table 1 for different_wavelengths , corresponding to the regimes of negative and positive effective linear refractive_index values . we see that in fishnet structure , the effective nonlinear coefficient is enhanced , due_to a strong field confinement in the dielectric . on the other_hand , the coefficient becomes complex . this means that nonlinearity reduces or increases losses , depending_on the sign of im ( γ ) . intuitively , it can_be understood because the nonlinearity effectively shifts the dispersion_curves [ 25 ] and changes the absorption due_to the frequency dependant losses . in conclusion , we have developed a systematic_approach for the rigorous_derivation of the coupled - mode equations in nonlinear periodic structures with loss and gain . this formulation is based_on the lorentz reciprocity theorem , and it allows_us_toBRcomponent parallel to v3 , x UNK , and the component perpendicular to v3 , x ⊥ : ⊥ · x UNK = 0 . x = x UNK + x ⊥ , x UNK = ( v UNK 3 · x ) v3 , x UNK ( 4 ) then , we also have ( 5 ) b · x = b · x ⊥ , x UNK = ( 0 . 619629x1 − 0 . 778849x2 − 0 . 0972326x5 ) v3 , so we_conclude that the “ neutral ” component of x , x UNK ( associated_with the zero eigenvalue λ 3 ) , does_not_depend at all on the attributable variables x3 and x4 , but only on the linear_combination ( 6 ) z3 : = v UNK 3 · x = 0 . 619629x1 − 0 . 778849x2 − 0 . 0972326x5 . we will return to this important fact when_discussing applications in the last section . 6 iuliana teodorescu and chris tsokos 3 . 1 . canonical analysis of the quadratic model . let b − represent the symmetric generalized_inverse of the matrix b ( [ 4
