a workflow base library on which activities may rely_on ; and of a number of runtime services , which are typically application dependent . di giusto & p_é_rezBRand r ≥ 2 p ( k ( 2 ) r > k ) ≥ p ( k ( 1 ) r > k ) and p ( k ( 2 ) r > k ) ≥ p ( rr > k ) 2 . for r = 2 , k ∈ n also p ( k ( 1 ) proof . 1 . by the formulae in theorem 4 . 2 above 2 > k ) ≥ p ( r2 > k ) UNK UNK n d = 0 sur ( k , d ) UNK n where we have used that UNK k UNK = nk . r > d ) ≥ p ( k ( 1 ) k UNK r > k ) =BRthe search_tree . for our test programs , we examined the size of the minimal tree with and without transpositions . the result is shown in figure 2 ( the method used to compute this graph will be explained in section 3 ) . note the logarithmic vertical scale . identifying transpositions can reduce the size of the minimal tree for a chess program searching to depth 9 by a factor of 4 . in checkers searching to depth 15 yields a difference of a factor of 9 . othello has less transpositions , although there still is a clear_advantage to identifying transpositions in the search space . in chess and checkers , a move affects few squares on the board , meaning that a move sequence a , b , c often yields the same position as the sequence c , b , a . this is often not true in othello , where moves can affect many squares , reduing the likelihood of transpositions occurring . it is interesting to note_that this figure also shows an odd / even effect , for the same reasons discussed_previously . to better_understand the nature of transpositions we gathered someBRin ( 8 ) are sorted in the decreasing order with p0 = 0 pm > pm − 1 > . . . > p1 > p0 > p − 1 > . . . p − ( k − 1 ) > p − k . they are called grosspowers and they themselves can_be written in the form ( 8 ) . in the record ( 8 ) , we write ① pi explicitly because in the new numeral positional system the number i in general is not equal to the grosspower pi . this gives the possibility to write_down numerals without indicating grossdigits equal to zero . the term having p0 = 0 represents the finite part of c because , due_to ( 6 ) , 0 = c0 . the terms having finite positive grosspowers represent the we have c0 ① simplest infinite parts of c . analogously , terms having negative finite grosspowers represent the simplest infinitesimal parts of c . for instance , the number ① − 1 = 1 mentioned_above is infinitesimal . note_that all infinitesimals are not equal to zero . particularly , 1 ① > 0 because it is a result of division of two positive_numbers . a number represented_by a numeral in the form ( 8 ) is called purely finite if it has neither infinite not infinitesimals parts . for instance , 2 is purely finite and 2 + 3 ① − 1 is not . all grossdigits ci are supposed to be purely finite . purely finite numbers are used on traditional computers and for_obvious_reasons have a special_importance for applications . all of the numbers introduced above can_be grosspowers , as_well , giving thus a possibilityBR. archidiacono , n . fornengo , c . giunti and a . melchiorri , phys . rev . d 86 , 065028 ( 2012 ) [ arxiv_: 1207 . 6515 [ astro - ph . co ] ] .
