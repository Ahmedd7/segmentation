atoms . as discussed before , the overlapping can_be controlled via the temporal delay between the two microwave_pulses . a comparison of the number of absorptions for different delays could test the effects predicted in this_paper . note , as discussed at the end of sect . 3 , that in the case of very_similar initial wave_functions ( very_small delays ) the changes of the absorption rate are very_small and probably undetectable from the experimental point of view . it is for this reason that our_proposal to observe the effect focus_on the dependence of the absorption rate on the overlapping degree , rather_than on the determination of the rate for particular values of the overlapping . 5 discussion we have shown how the absorption properties of a pair of identical atoms are related to the ( anti ) symmetric properties of its state . this is another example of the dependence of optical_properties of quantum_systems on their quantum states . the process resembles in some aspects the superradiance phenomenon , but we must also emphasize the differences . in superradiance the collective state leads to strong_correlations_between the atomic_dipoles , which are in the basis of the emission enhancement . the collective states originally_introduced by 8 dicke had a high degree of symmetry : the atom - radiation description was invariant_under atom permutations . this closely_resembles our_approach , where the ( anti ) symmetry of the states of the identical atoms generates the modifications of the absorption properties . however , in the case of superradianceBRf as the average fraction of agents getting food . thus , formally , f = * 1 n xi min [ ai ( t ) , ai ( t + 1 ) ] + , ( 12 ) where the bar means time average in the steady_state and h . . . i means ensemble_average . thus , eq . 12 computed in the steady_state will give the steady_state value of utilization f . let_us_consider the case when the agents choose restaurants randomly . the utilization fraction f is about 0 . 476 ( 5 ) as computed from numerical_simulations . we can provide an analytical argument for this . the probability of finding a restaurant with exactly m agents is given by π ( m ) = 1 m ! exp (BR− ↑ + ↓ + ↑ − ↑ − ↓ − ↓ − ↑ + ↓ + ↑ + ↓ + ↑ − ↑ − ↓ − ↓ − ↑ + ↓ + ↑ + ↓ + ↑ − ↑ − ↓ − ↓ − ↑ + ↓ + ↑ + ↓ + ↑ − ↓ − ↑ + ↓ + ↑ fig . 4 .

[ 7 ] . 3 figure 3 : : the minimum variability time_scales are characteristic_features of burst type . the mvts of long ( black_histogram ) and short ( red_histogram ) form two separate distributions showing that the long and short_grbs have intrinsically different values of mvts . the median values ( shown as vertical_dashed_lines ) are 0 . 024 and 0 . 25 respectively for long and short_grbs . if the variability time is a characteristic burst parameter then one_expects it be a function of the grb distance since itBRparameters , which are given in the caption of fig . 4 and in table i . there are table i . three sets of imaging and sequence parameters used for demonstrations of anatomical imaging . the parameters that are the same for three sets are given in the caption of fig . 4 . the resolution in horizontal_plane was verified with a phantom , but in the depth resolution was calculated_using the gradient strength and duration . the resolution slightly changes across the image due_to field non - uniformity beyond the first - order gradients . set # 1 2 3 − t gon − t p 2 / π π t t − ms 25 25 28 t gon ms 51 51 51 t goff ms 22 22 25 gymax hz / cm 116 135_135 ny 41BRtwo_types of accretion modes ( krticka_et_al . 2012 ) . the first mode appears in the case of strong x - ray_source which significantly_affects the wind ionization state . this accretion mode produces a slow_wind that can_be accreted by the ns in a large_amount . consequently , the ns re2 s . karino mains as a strong x - ray_source . hereafter , we call this type of accretion mode as a slow - bright mode . the second type of accretion modes may_occur in the case of a weak x - ray_source that does_not_significantly influence the wind ionization state . this second mode results in faster wind solution . we call this accretion mode as a fast - faint mode . if it is confirmed that the bimodality of the accretion_flow really exists , it contributes to the promotion of understanding x - ray properties of hmxbs . for example , it may_help to understand the observed difference of windfed binaries , such as normal hmxbs , super giant fast x - ray_transients ( sfxts ) , and recently observed faint x - ray_sources ( wijnands et_al . 2013 ) . furthermore , if some perturbations cause switching between two accretion modes in particular system , a drastic variability of x - ray_luminosity may be produced ( krticka_et_al . 2012 ) . 2006 ; lutovinov_et_al . the bimodality of the accretion mode is suggested by krticka_et_al .

( 18 ) it gives_usBR. unfortunately , this reduction of the hilbert_space can not be done when additional pump_lasers are considered since in that case all particle modes will be coupled in some way to the ground_state . note_that in addition to a finite coupling_strength energy_conservation has to be fulfilled for efficient population_transfer . this can_be controlled via the detuning between the pumping_laser and the cavity_mode , ∆ n c , at_least to_some_extent . nevertheless , even in this simple generic case a two mode picture per excitation frequency as it appears in an_infinite trap size limit cannot_be expected . b . coupling matrices for a harmonic particle trap for a square - well potential of tailored length as above we find rather sparsely_populated coupling matrices with nonzero_entries determined_by the specific_choice of the cavity length , trap size and pump mode . in the more_realistic case of e . g . a gaussian trap , the matrices are , as shown in fig . 3 , much_more densely_populated . this considerably enlarges the necessary ( a ) ( b ) fig . 3 : ( a ) first few particle eigenmodes of an harmonic_trap potential and 5th cavity_mode .
