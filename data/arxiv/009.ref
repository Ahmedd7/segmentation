a brief_overview here for the sake of completeness . notation 1 .  denotes a finite_alphabet of symbols . the set of all finite but possibly_unbounded strings on  is denoted_by  ? ( 32 ) . the set of finite strings over  form a concatenative monoid , with the empty_word  as identity . the set of strictly infinite strings on  is denoted as  ! , where ! denotes the first transfinite cardinal . for a string x , jxj denotes its length , and for a set a , jaj denotes its cardinality . definition 1 ( qsp ) . a qsp h is a discrete time  - valued strictly_stationary , ergodic stochastic_process , i : e : h = fxt : xt is a  - valued_random_variable ; t 2 n [ f0gg ( 1 ) a process is ergodic if moments may be calculated from a sufficiently_long realization , and strictly_stationary if moments are time - invariant . we next formalize the connection of qsps to pfsa generators . we develop the theory assuming multiple realizations of the qsp h , and fixed initial_conditions . using ergodicity , we will be then able_to apply our construction to a single sufficiently_long realization , where initial_conditions cease to matter . definition 2 (  - algebra on infinite strings ) . for the set of infinite strings on  , we define b to be the smallest  - algebra_generated by the family of sets fx  ! : x 2  ? g . lemma 1 . every qsp induces a probability space (  ! ; b ;  ) . proof : assuming stationarity , we can construct a probability_measure  : b !

( 2011 ) and gilliland ( 2011 ) ) . however , we find that rv_jitter is not strongly_correlated with the amplitude of photometric_variability : a kendall_‚Äô_s_œÑ test yields a confidence of 80_% when we exclude the star with the highest rv_rms and 86 % when we include it . such a finding , while perhaps counterintuitive , is not_surprising given that chromospheric_activity and rv_rms are only_weakly_correlated even in dwarfs , as saar et_al . ( 1998 ) demonstrate with a sample comprised of a range of spectral_types . we thus confirm that amplitude of photometric_variability by itself is a poor predictor of rv_jitter . nonetheless , we find that rv_jitter is strongly manifested in photometric_variability in other forms , namely in the structure of the photometric_variability ‚Äô_s fourier_power_spectrum . we show a log - log plot of the rv_rms compared with the number of significant periodogram peaks ( those at_least 10 % as strong as the maximum periodogram peak ) in fig . 6 . this is a key result of this_work , with a kendall_‚Äô_s_œÑ confidence of 98 % ( see table 2 ) : low - amplitude variable_stars that are noisier in rv have additional frequency components in the corresponding light_curve . this finding seems to indicate that there is only one dominant frequency of variability in the light_curve of the lowBR. e . , th_¬¥_eado , s . , vauclair , s . , et_al . 2012 , a & a , 543 , a96 ferguson , j . w . , alexander , d . r . , allard , f . , et_al . 2005 , apj , 623 , 585 formicola , a . , imbriani , g . , costantini , h . , et_al . 2004 , physics_letters_b , 591 , 61 freeman , k . c . 1993 , in astronomical_society of the pacific_conference_series , vol . 49 , galaxy_evolution . the milky_way perspective , ed . s . r . majewski , 125 gilliland , r . l . , marcy , g . w . , rowe , j . f . , et_al . 2013 , apj , 766 , 40 gilliland , r . l . , mccullough , p . r . , nelan , e . p . , et_al . 2011 , apj , 726 , 2 gilmore , g . 1999 , baltic_astronomy , 8 , 203 girardi , l . , bertelli , g . , bressan , a . , et_al . 2002 , a & a , 391 , 195 gizon , l . , ballot , j . , michel , e . , et_al . 2013 , proceedings of the national_academy of science , 110 , 13267 gonzalez , g . , carlson , m . k . , & tobin , r . w . 2010 , mnras , 403 , 1368 gough , d . o . 1990 , in lecture_notes in physics , berlin_springer_verlag , vol . 367 , progress of seismology of theBRby using the mean - field hydrodynamics model of ko11 . then we use our dynamo code surya to construct dynamo_models of these stars . the only nonlinearity in our model is the standard Œ± quenching which is sufficient to produce stable solutions over the parameter regime we have studied . another possible source of nonlinearity is the back - reaction of the dynamo - generated magnetic_field on the large - scale flows such as the differential_rotation and the meridional_circulation ( see , e . g . , kuker et_al . 1999 ; rempel 2006 ) . in this preliminary_investigation of stellar_dynamos , we have not_included this back - reaction . this is certainly justified for slow_rotators like the sun , on the ground that the amplitude of torsional_oscillations ( the cyclic variation in differential_rotation ) is small compared to the absolute_value of the rotational_velocity ( basu_&_antia 2003 ; howe et_al . 2005 ; chakraborty et_al . 2009 ) and the variation of the meridional_circulation with the solar_cycle is also not so significant ( chou & dai 2001 ; hathaway & rightmire 2010 ; karak &_choudhuri 2012 ) . however , for 1m_‚äô stars rotating much_faster , we have seen that the magnetic_field generated is much_stronger and its back - reaction may no_longer be negligible . this effect should_be explored in the future . 11 our results are in qualitative_agreement_with many_aspects of observational_data . for example , we find that the dimensionless amplitude fm of the toroidal_flux increases with increasing rotation . we naively_expect the ca h / k and x - ray_emissions to go as f 2 m . we find that we can match the observational_dataBR. , invariants ) . a more fundamental problem is that traditional checksums and error - correcting_codes do_not suit floating - point computations well [ 16 ] . such computations naturally commit rounding_error , which exact ( bitwise ) codes forbid . inexact codes ( that use floating - point sums ) can_be sensitive to rounding_error , and commit is possible that more_expensive recovery and significantly_more redundant storage could_help [ 26 ] . however , works like [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] suggest that correcting faults might not be necessary , if their effects on the algorithm are detectable and bounded . in general , this_paper favors ‚Äú opening_up the black_box_‚Äù and understanding the effects of soft error on algorithms , rather_than_trying to detect and correct all such errors before they affect algorithms ‚Äô behavior . themselves . it it iii . project overview to explore the relation_between data representation and soft errors , we first construct an analytic model of a soft error in an ieee - 754 floating - point scalar , and then extend this to a dot_product . we uncover through analysis that the binary pattern of the exponent can_be exploited for fault_tolerance . we show this graphically via a case study using monte_carlo_sampling of random_vectors , and then extend the idea of data scaling to matrices by using sparse_matrix equilibration . to demonstrate the feasibly and utility of our work we analyze the gmres_algorithm and instrument the computationally_intensive orthogonalization phase . we count the possible absolute_errors that can_be introduced via a bit_flip in a dot_product ,BR- orbital chain cheng - chien chen1 , michel van veenendaal1 , 2 , thomas p . devereaux3 , krzysztof wohlfeld3 1advanced photon source , argonne_national_laboratory , argonne , illinois_60439 , usa_2department of physics , northern_illinois_university , de kalb , illinois_60115 , usa and 3stanford institute for materials and energy sciences , slac_national laboratory and stanford_university , menlo_park , california_94025 , usa ( dated_:_june 27 , 2014 ) using a combined analytical and numerical approach , we study the collective_spin and orbital_excitations in a spin - orbital chain under a crystal_field . irrespective of the crystal field_strength , these excitations can_be universally described by fractionalized fermions . each of the fractional quasiparticles carries both spin and orbital quantum_numbers , and thereby the spin and orbital variables are always entangled in the collective_excitations . the result shows that the recently_reported spin - orbital_separation occurs solely_due to a particular choice of basis , which is valid only when crystal fields fully polarize the orbital_degrees of freedom . the persistent fractionalization contrasts strikingly with the case of a spin_chain , where fractionalized spinons cannot_be individually observed but confined to form magnons of integral quantum_numbers in a strong_magnetic_field . pacs_numbers_:_75 . 25 . dk , 71 . 10 . fd , 75 . 10 . pq , 78 . 70 . - g introduction - strong correlation_effects can lead toBR) ab Œ≥ ( a + b ) ‚â§ UNK a + b ‚àí 1 a UNK 2 ‚àí b .
