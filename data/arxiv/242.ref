( 4 . 4 ) . without_any loss of generality , we choose b to be a real positive_constant . then the second_term in eq . ( 4 . 12 ) diverges as u → 0 ( z →_∞ ) . therefore we have to set b = 0 for the bound_states . then the solution which is finite at z = ∞ is ψ ( z ) = sechb ( z ) f ( z ) = n ( ez + e − z ) b 2f1 UNK UNK UNK b + − 1 2 v + 1 4 , b + 1 2 + v + 1 4 ; 1 + b ; e − z ez + e − z , ( 4 . 13 ) UNK where n is the normalization_factor . the bound_state wave_function should tend to zero when z →_∞ . the solution given in eq .
