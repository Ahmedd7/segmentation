indeed , proposition 1 . 2 comes_close to showing this if d ( · ) decreases_gradually enough . we may tentatively_conclude then that the perturbation of our model which includes radial_dependence of particles without_making more_profound changes to inter - particle interaction is not a suitable physical context to study the phenomenon of gelation . 2 . 4 . 3 a weaker_notion of gelation : an analogue of weak_turbulence a weaker_notion of solution blowup than finite gelation time is the condition that ( 2 . 3 ) z ∞ 0 zrd mrfm ( x , t ) dxdm →_∞ as t →_∞ , 25 for some r > 1 . in [ 31 , appendix ] , an analogy is drawn between the non - linear_schrodinger_equation and the smoluchowski_pde under which , in the case of the cubic defocussing nls , the criterion above corresponds_to weak_turbulence . the condition ( 2 . 3 ) corresponds_to ongoing coagulation under which a positive fraction of mass reaches arbitrarily_high mass nodes at sufficiently late_time . it is argued non - rigorously in [ 31 ] on the basis of scaling considerations for the pde that , modelling β (BRghz spectral_indices at 2 . 4 yr are α c c ( 2 . 4yr ) = − 1 . 62 ± 0 . 33 , respectively . at an age of 2 . 8 yr , the 5 . 0 to 8 . 5 ghz spectral_index results in α x l ( 2 . 4yr ) = − 0 . 44 ± 0 . 09 , and α x c ( 2 . 8yr ) = − 1 . 40 ± 0 . 83 . the flat spectral_index that we observe at 1 . 4 yr indicates that the sn emission is becoming transparent at ∼ 500 days_after explosion . we note_that once a sn reaches_its maximum ( at time tpeak ) and enters its optically_thin phase , a higher flux_density is observed at lower_frequencies ( weiler_et_al . 2002 ) , as we observe for sn_2010p at 2 . 4 and 2 . 8 yr . the knee in the spectrum at 2 . 4 yr would_be a con6 romero - canizales et_al . table 4 . sn_2010p measured and contamination - free flux_densities . epoch observed adopted corrected label tobs − t0 ( days ) ν s ν ν ( ghz ) ( µ jy ) ( ghz ) s ν ( µ jy ) e1_e2_e3_e4_e5_e6_e7 e8_e9 e10_e11 e12_e13 19 443 443 521 540 868 876 886 1014 1025 1030 1046 1081 5 . 0 29BRof the reference point and compare it to the optimal multiplicative approximation . 23 x1 = 1 , x µ = cx1 = 1 , x µ < cx1 > 1 , x µ = cx1 > 1 , x µ < c theorem 9 let f : [ 1 , c ] → [ 1 , c ] be a convex front with f ( x ) = c / x where c > 1 is an_arbitrary constant . then UNK x hyp opt ( µ , r , f ) = { x1 , . . . , x µ } , where xi , 1 ≤ i ≤ µ , depend_on the choice of the reference point r as follows : 1 . if r1 ≤ c − 1 / ( µ − 1 ) and r2 ≤ c − 1 / ( µ − 1 ) , then x1 = 1 , x µ = c , xi = c ( i − 1 ) / ( µ − 1 ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ µ , and 1 2 µ − 2 . opt ( µ , r , f ) ) = c app ( UNK x hyp 1 , then x1 > 1 , x µ < c , xi = ( ci r µ − i + 1 UNK UNK cBR. dispersive imaging is often the most attractive technique for imaging dense_clouds , although it does require a highly detuned ( hundreds of atomic linewidths ) probe_beam and involves non - trivial image_processing . resonant fluorescence from a high intensity probe_beam can also be used to image dense_clouds [ 3 ] . while fluorescent imaging is robust and requires no signal_processing , it suffers_from smaller signal than other imaging_techniques . this is because in fluorescent imaging , one collects a fraction of all scattered_light , while in other techniques one collects the entire available signal which is imprinted on the probe_beam . the babinet_’ s principle technique we describe here uses absorption of a high - intensity resonant probe to image dense_clouds . we have used it to study the selftrapping dynamics of quasi - 1d gases in a 2d optical_lattice [ 14 ] . its features are that it is simple to implement , has high signal to noise , and requires minimal image_processing compared to dispersive imaging . however , it requires a very_high intensity probe and involves a reduction of the resolution by a factor √ 2 and a small_amount of density - dependent distortion at very_high densities ( although the distortion is smaller_than for low - intensity absorption_imaging ) . in our experiment , a resonant probe_beam of intensity io and 1 / e2 waist 1 . 3 mm impinges_on a 87rb_bec and continues through the imaging system shown_schematically in fig . 1 .BRu UNK lpj + lim j →_∞ where we used that pj ≤ q for j sufficiently_large . the previous implies that UNK u UNK l1 = 1 . from fatou_’_s_lemma we can then infer lim_inf p → 1 + λ s 1 , p ( ω ) = lim j →_∞ λ s 1 , pj ( ω ) = lim pj j →_∞ [ upj ] w s , pj ( rn ) ≥ [ u ] w s , 1 ( rn ) ≥ hs ( ω ) , where we used ( 5 . 6 ) in the last_inequality . UNK theorem 7 . 2 ( convergence of the minimizers ) . let ω ⊂_rn be an open and bounded lipschitz set and for every p > 1 let up achieve the minimum ( 3 . 1 ) . then there_exists a sequence { pj } j ∈ n converging to 1 such that { upj } j ∈ n converges_strongly in lq ( ω ) for every q < ∞ to a solution u1 of UNK UNK [ u ] w s , 1 ( rn ) : UNK u UNK l1 ( ω ) = 1 , u ≥ 0 = hs ( ω ) . λ s 1 , 1 ( ω ) = min u ∈ w s , 1 moreover u1 ∈ l ∞ ( ω ) and we have 0 ( ω ) ( 7 . 3 ) UNK u1 UNK l ∞ ( ω ) ≤ where b is any n − dimensional ball . proof . observe_that we have UNK nBRsufficient_condition for a lie_algebra to be isomorphic to the kantor ’_s construction attached to a structurable_algebra is given by the existence of a sl2 - triple { e , h , f } ( that is , [ h , e ] = 2e , [ h , f ] = − 2f , [ e , f ] = h ) in l such that l is the direct_sum of irreducible_modules for h { e , h , f } i of dimensions 1 , 3 , and 5 ; the only ideal of l which centralizes { e , h , f } is { 0 } , and l is generated_by the eigenspaces 2 and − 2 for ad h [ abg02 , theorem 6 . 10 ] . the relevance for_our_purposes comes_from the fact that exceptional_lie_algebras are obtained in terms of kantor ’_s constructions attached to certain structurable_algebras . some examples of this situation are shown next : example 6 . consider the tensor_products of composition algebras : c = f ⊗ c , k ⊗ c , q ⊗ c , and c ⊗ c . these areBRsect . 7 . the translation is then defined to be the composition n ( f ) df = nsubst ⊳ h ( n ( s1 ) k . . . k n ( sn ) ) . the first net nsubst compactly represents substitutions σ : r ∪ i ∪ f → p ∪ n and implements reference counting . it only consists of places and is detailed in sect . 3 . 1 . the second net h ( n ( s1 ) k . . . k n ( sn ) ) represents the control flow of the fcp . each net n ( si ) is a finite_automaton that reflects the control flow of thread si . importantly , the transitions of n ( si ) are annotated with synchronisation actions and sets of commands that explicitly handle the introduction and removal of name bindings . parallel_composition k synchronises the subnets of all threads . the operator places the nets side by side and merges pairs of transitions with complementary synchronisation actions send ( a , b ) and rec ( a , b ) . hiding h then removes the original transitions . after hiding , transitions in the control flow net only carry name binding commands . the implementation operator ⊳ implements them by adding arcs between the control flow net and nsubst . we elaborate_on the construction of the control flow in sect . 3 . 2 , and sect . 3 . 3 illustrates the translation on an example . 3 . 1 . petri_net representation of substitutions . a substitution σ : r ∪BRγ ( v ) ω ∗ UNK + k xv ∈ vn UNK ( b γ ( v ) ω ∗ ) ⊤ b σ ( v ) b γ ( v ) ω ∗ ) ⊤ b σ vb γ ( v ) ω ∗ − ( b γ ( v ) ω ∗ b σ nb γ ω ∗ UNK k xv ∈ vn UNK ( b γ ( v ) ω ∗ ) ⊤ b σ ( v ) b γ ( v ) ω ∗ − b γ ⊤ 1 UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK b σ v − b σ ( v ) UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK ∞ ω ∗ UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK k xv ∈ vn UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK b γ ( v ) zrz ⊤ r . ≤ 1 1 = 1 + 1 2 , ( 17 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) where the inequality follows by lemma 5 . 1 and the fact thatb γ ( v ) which implies ( b γ ( v ) ω ∗ ) ⊤ b σ ( v ) b γ ( v ) ω ∗ is chosen
