( to rephrase this in autoencoder terminology : our model comes_equipped_with a decoder function at each layer . but this is not enough to guarantee an efficient encoder function — this may be tantamount to breaking cryptographic_schemes . ) so we make the following additional_assumptions_about the unknown “ ground_truth deep net ” ( see section 2 ) : ( i ) eachBRsame as lao0 . 5f0 . 5bis2 , this compound is also a conventional electronphonon_coupling induced superconductor . pacs_numbers_:_74 . 20 . pq , 74 . 70 . - b , 74 . 25 . kc i . introduction in 2012 , a new superconductor bi4o4s3 has_been_found . 1 this material has a layered_structure composed of a stacking of rock - salt - type bis2_layers and bi4o4 ( so4 ) 1 − x blocking_layers . 1 the stacking structure of the superconducting and blocking_layer is analogous to those of high - tc_cuprates , 2 and iron_pnictides . 3 thus the discoveryBR- 1 agn x - ray_agn 0 . 0 2 c p m l a g σ 21 . 7 43 . 3 65 . 0 3 . 27 < zspec < 3 . 35 3 . 0 3 . 4 3 . 8 zspec zphot = zps + σ z ( 1 + z ) 36 . 9 36 . 8 36 . 7 36 . 6 α j2000 [ ° ] s e i x a l a g f o # 10 5 0 0 fig . 4 . left : zoom - in of the sky distribution of all galaxies inBRn λ j , n . extracting_subsequences , we can assume_that s ′ let s ′ as n → + ∞ . observe_that there_exists a unique_solution v j such that j , n has a limit θ j ∈ r ∪_{ ± ∞ } l of the linear wave_equation ( 1 . 11 ) lim j , n UNK UNK UNK UNK h 1 × l2 n →_∞ UNK UNK UNK ~ v j l UNK s ′ j , n UNK − ~ u j UNK s ′ letting t ′ l follows . j , n = − τ ′ = 0 . indeed , if θ j ∈ r , it_follows from ( 3 . 19 ) that θ j ∈ imax ( u j ) , and v j l is the solution of the linear wave_equation with initial_data ~ u j ( θ j ) at t = θ j . on the other_hand , if θ j = + ∞ ( respectively − ∞ ) , then by ( 3 . 19 ) , u j scatters_forward in time ( respectively backward in time ) , and the existence of v j j , n } n , j ≥ 1 ,BR( 2 ) so that there is i0 ∈ i for which the representation x 7 → ρ ( x ) lp ( xi0 , µ ) is spatial . for p = 2 , in definition 2 . 7 ( 3 ) we use spatial representations as in definition 7 . 1 of [ 16 ] . up to unitary_equivalence , however , we may as_well just ask for * - representations . 10 n . christopher_phillips lemma 2 . 8 . let d ∈ z > 0 , and let g ⊂ inv ( md ) be a finite subgroup . then the following are equivalent : ( 1 ) the natural action of g on cd is irreducible .
