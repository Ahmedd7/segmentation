atypical as_well as typical ones . therefore , more memory_locations participate in the release of ' ingredients ' for the next instant . these locations will have_previously_been modified by ( and can therefore be said to ' store ' in a distributed_manner ) not only concepts that obviously share properties with the stimulus , but also concepts that are correlated with it in unexpected ways . a flat activation function is conducive to creative , associative_thought because it provides a high_probability of evoking one or more concepts not usually associated_with the stimulus . thus we_propose that representational theories — inBR( 3 ) depends_on b2 and b3 . multiplying the columns of the matrix ( 3 ) by g2 = 1 + h2 as needed we can make the diagonal of b2 to be zero without_changing the entries of b ( j ) and a ( j ) . condition ( iii ) of theorem 4 determines the entries 1 below the diagonal of b2 . hence , b2 depends_on 36 parameters . condition ( iv ) of theorem 4 and theorem 7 determine the entries on and below the diagonal of b3 . thus , b3 depends_on 36 parameters . we obtain the following result . corollary 9 an extremal self - dual code of length 72 withBRrotation_period of a neutron_star ( sidoli 2013 ) , and , by definition , all members of the class have supergiant donor_stars ( e . g . chaty 2010 ) . many of the systems show modulation on the apparent orbital_periods of the systems ( e . g . sidoli_et_al . 2007 ) . in the corbet_diagram of spin period plotted_versus orbital_period , the sfxts share paramter space with both the be x - ray_binaries and the traditional persistent supergiant wind - fed systems ( sidoli 2013 ) . there remains debate_about_whether the systems have stellar_winds with strong equatorial components ( e . g . sidoli_et_al . 2007 ) , are clumpy ( e . gBR= ( c0 + c2 ) ψ † ψ − 1 + ( c0 + c2 ) ψ † − 1 ψ 1 + ( c0 + c2 ) ψ † hc − 1 − 1 = ( c0 − c2 ) ψ † ψ − 1 . + ( c0 + c2 ) ψ † − 1 ψ 0 1 0 1 0 ψ 0 ψ 0 ( a2 ) in conclusion , we have studied the dynamics of a rubidium spinor_condensate in a time - dependent magnetic these elements describe collisions of atoms that preserve the projection of the spin of each atom . the off - diagonal_elements , on the other_hand , are responsible_for collisions changing the atomic spin projections but conserving the projection of the total spin . they are equal ψ 0 − 1 ψ 1 hc10 = c2 ψ † hc0 − 1 = c2 ψ † hc1 − 1 = 0 . 0 ( a3 ) dent : the terms with coefficients c0 and c2 can_be expressed with the help of scattering_lengths a0 and a2 , where c0 = 4 π  2 ( a0 + a2 ) / 3m and c2 = 4 π  2 ( a2 − a0 ) / 3m [ 22 ] . the scattering_lengths a0 and a2 determine the collisions of atoms in a channel of the total spin 0 and 2 , respectively . according_to [ 23 ] the a0 = 5 . 387nm and a2 = 5 . 313nm . the f are spin - 1BRpotential function ( 10 ) and the unit radius constraint of spherical_codes , is given by g ( cs ( n , m ) , λ ) = g ( cs ( n , m ) ) + λ m ( 11 ) m UNK UNK sm2 − 1 UNK . the necessary_conditions for a global_minimum of the potential function ( 10 ) m = 1 ∂ g ( cs ( n , m ) , λ ) = 0 and ∂ g ( cs ( n , m ) , λ ) = 0 with m = 1 , . . . , m and n = 1BR0 ( n ) with χ ( − 1 ) = ( − 1 ) k and such that ( for composite n ) the involutions wm commute . then ek ( n , χ ) + : = mk ( γ 0 ( n ) + , χ ) ∩ ek ( n , χ γ 0 ( n ) ) has dimension 1 except for k = 1 , χ 6 = ψ , k = 2 , χ = 1 ( in which cases ek ( n , χ ) + = { 0 } ) . in the one - dimensional cases we write e ( χ ) for the element of ek ( n , χ ) + whose fourier_expansion at ∞ has constant term 1 ( if n is fixed ) . similar to the case of modular_forms for the full modular_group , multiplication by ∆ n defines an injective linear_map from mk ( γ 0 ( n ) + , χ ) to mk + k1 ( n ) ( γ 0 ( n ) + , χ ψ k1 ( n ) ) whose image is the space of cusp_forms . it will therefore be useful to twist a given character χ byBRσ 1 ) be a signed subgraph consisting of one odd edge_connecting distinct_vertices and the two odd loops at these vertices . let 13 ( g2 , σ 2 ) be the signed subgraph consisting of the remaining edges and the ends these edges . then ( 2 , 0 ) ∈ i ( g1 , σ 1 ) e + i ( g2 , σ 2 ) o , while ( 0 , 0 ) , ( 1 , 0 ) , ( 2 , 0 ) UNK ∈ [ i ( ( g1 , σ 1 ) − v ) + i ( ( g2 , σ 2 ) − v ) + { ( 1 , 1 ) } ] ∪ [ i ( g1 , σ 1 ) + i ( g2 , σ 2 ) ] ∪ [ i ( g1 , σ 1 ) o + i ( g2 , σ 2 ) e ] . switching the roles of odd and even shows that the term i (
