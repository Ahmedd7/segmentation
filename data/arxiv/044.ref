( 5 ) in the following section , we will consider the second_order asymptotic_behavior of hd ( ξ − 1 ∂ x ( a ) ∩ ( x ⊖ a b ) \ ( x ⊕ a w ) ) for r - regular sets x when a tends_to zero . the main_result is a formula similar to ( 4 ) but with the support functions replaced_by certain quadratic terms . choosing ( b , w ) = ( bl , wl ) , equation ( 5 ) shows that this has implications for the asymptotic_behavior of ad − 2enl and thus for the asymptotic mean of vd − 2 . 4 hit - or - miss transforms of r - regular sets as explained in the introduction , estimating vi causes problems for i < d − 1 even for polygons , so we need some strong assumptions on x . thus we consider the class of so - called r - regular sets : definition 4 . 1 a closed_subset x ⊆ rd is called r - regular for r > 0 if for all x ∈ ∂ x there_exists two balls biBRa fractal_structure . this was_conjectured in [ chl11 ] where some evidence was provided to support this theory . one may characterize ‘ fractalness ’ of a set as the existence of self - similarities at arbitrarily_small scales . by theorem 1 , any strong winding_number one satellite operator gives a self - similarity for cex ; however , while there_exist several such operators ( see [ cdr14 , satellite operators with distinct iterates 3 figure 2 . the satellite operator p . section 2 ] ) , the question of scale has_not_been addressed . this is the objective of the main theorem of this_paper , which follows . main theorem . for any strong winding_number one satellite operator p with a legendrian diagram where tb ( p ) > 0 and tb ( p ) + rot ( p ) ≥ 2 , ( e . g . the one shown in figure 2 ) and any knot k with tb ( k ) = 2g ( k ) − 1 , the knots p i ( k ) are distinct in cex and c . that is , pBRthe heavy singlet_state ( σ ) is integrated_out , it is related to the fundamental parameters λ 56 and λ 65 via λ 0 = 2 λ 56 λ 65 . λ 65 + λ 56 the parameters λ 56 and λ 65 are the coefficients of the quartic_potential , defined in eq . 9 of [ 19 ] , and must both be non - zero to achieve collective symmetry_breaking and generate a higgs_quartic_coupling . rather_than expressing m2 σ in terms of these two free_parameters , we instead choose to parameterize it in terms of λ 0 and a single free parameter , k σ , as shown in the last_line of eq . 3 . 3 . there_exist a number of theoretical constraints that can_be placed on these parameters , primarily_due to perturbativity requirements . the value of the mixing_angle β is limited by two constraints , the first of which is the requirement that λ 0 < 4 π , leading to an_upper_bound of UNK UNK UNK UNK m2 tan_β < UNK 8 π v2 + 4 a0 π v2m2BRuniversity , ca , u . s . a . , march_2013 doi_: 10 . 7321_/ jscse . v3 . n3 . 90 e - issn :_2251 - 7545 limb exposed . in addition to new materials , the use of electronics has become very common in artificial limbs . myoelectric and switch - controlled the amputees to directly control the artificial limb . cad and cam are often_used the design and manufacture of artificial limbs . limbs allow to assist in techniques used b . the variety of prostheses ranges from mostly passive or cosmetic types on one end to primarily functional types on the other . the aim of many prosthetic limbs lies in between . passive prosthetic limbs are also known as cosmetic prostheses . those amputees , who think their outlook is more essential , use these types of prostheses . functional prostheses generally can_be classified_into_two_categories . cable - operated prosthetic limbs [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] are typically less_costly and generally have lighter mass . they have greater physical response and are highly robust prosthetic limbs . yet , a cable - operated prosthetic limb is usually not visually attractive as compared to a myoelectric prosthesis . also , the amputee has to apply a larger force in order to operate the prosthesis . externallypowered prosthetic limbs [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] are artificial extremities driven by electronically controlled motors and they deliver greater functionality and stronger grasping power , accompanied_by better outlook , yet again they could_be hefty and costly . these prosthetic limbs are operated using motors and batteries controlled byBRln UNK e − 2 µ r0k − β 1 − δ 1k UNK } , 23 there_exists γ > 0 such that γ max − ε k { r0k + δ k } ≤ γ ≤ γ max . 2 · max for such a γ > 0 , the inequality ( 36 ) holds . we then conclude_that v γ + 2 γ v γ ≤ 0 , for any t ≥ 0 . similarly to theorem 6 , we have α 1kxt ( ϕ ) k2_l2 ≤ v γ ( xt ( ϕ ) ) with α 1 = min k { e − 2 γ ( r0k + δ k ) λ min ( pk ) } > 0 , and v γ ( ϕ ) ≤ α 2k ϕ k2 c , with α 2 = ( r0n + δ n ) · max from theorem 5 , with α = q α 2 α 1 example 7 . consider the plant λ max ( pk ) . l2 - exponential_stability of x ( t , ϕ )BR4uc   fese   film   under   different   magnetic   fields :   where   dr / dh   starts   to   increase .   insert :   resistance   of   the   4uc   fese   film   from   2 - ­_‐ 150k   under   different   magnetic   fields .     7t ,   with   the   arrow   showing       0t ,       1t   and   fig . 4 .   representative   frequency   dependency   of     χ !
