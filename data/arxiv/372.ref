( 5 ) note however that the above relation is not enough to reconstruct the whole eigenstates , because the transpositions tj are not enough to generated the wbm weyl_group . one_needs another projection to be able_to reconstruct the whole group . reflection_coefficient for the left boundary : projection on 1 , x2 . . . , xmi this case is new for open case and characterizes the presence of a boundary . a ( m ) gr1 = r + ( eikg1 ) a ( m ) g with r + ( z ) = − z2 1 − 1 z + β − α 1 − zBRjiang , lang , and caves [ 4 ] showed_that the state ψ in UNK opt is the only nonclassical product state , i . e . , not a coherent_state , that produces no modal entanglement after a beam_splitter . these results_indicate that , as in [ 18 ] , modal entanglement is not a crucial resource for quantum - enhanced interferometry . caves pointed_out that using squeezed_states in an interferometer allows one to achieve sensitivities below the shot - noise limit [ 19 ] ; this original scheme , often simply dubbed_“ squeezed - state interferometry , ” involves injecting squeezed_vacuum into the secondary input_port of an interferometer . that squeezing the light into the primary input_port , in addition to inputting squeezed_light into the secondary port , is advantageous was first shown by bondurant and shapiro [ 20 ] and further investigated by kim and sanders [ 21 ] . all these papers , however , included a mean_field in at_least_one of the input modes . paris argued [ 22 ] that if_one_considers arbitrary squeezedcoherent states as interferometer inputs , putting all the available powerBRsuitably_small values of q2 , these contours are ellipses for the first pass - band , but they are hyperbolae for the second pass - band . moreover , both of the components of the group - velocity vectors are parallel with the corresponding phase - velocity components on the first pass - band , but on the second frequency pass - band , only their x2components are parallel while their x1 - components are antiparallel with the corresponding components of the phase - velocity vectors . hence , the refraction properties here are the same as those of the two - phase composites ;
