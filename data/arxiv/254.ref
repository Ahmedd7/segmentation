( 3 . 3 ) the merging between the sm and the mssm happens at the scale q0 and the running from the low scale q0 to the high scale m can_be done straightforwardly using the two - loop mssm rge and the boundary_conditions ( 3 . 3 ) . this is shown in the left_panel ( right_panel ) of figBRyu , planet . space [ 19 ] s . ghosh , n . chakrabarti , m . khan , and m . r . gupta , sci . 38 , 543 ( 1990 ) .
