( 1 ) scattering on links is illustrated by two - colored ( red and blue ) circles in fig . 1 . these circles separate each link into two “ half - links ” ( each carrying the same “ spatial ” index n as the whole link ) . at the nodes of the network the scattering of fluxes is notice_that scattering at the nodes does_not_mix the two subnetworks , and we illustrate the nodal scattering matrices by the red and blue star - shaped regions in fig . 1 . each subnetwork is a copy of the cc network , and they are coupled by the link scattering . the 2 × 2 scattering matrices in eq . ( 2 ) are chosen as s ( t ) = UNK √ 1 − t2 − t t √ 1 − t2 UNK , ( 3 ) with non - random parameters ta1 , etc . disorder in the model is introduced through random phases acquired by fluxes along the half - links , that is , between the scattering events on the links and at the nodes . the total scattering_matrix for propagation along a link in eq .
