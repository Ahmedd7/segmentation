[ 1 ] , § 14 . 3 ) , however the construction is presented in such a way that the generalization to higher dimension is not immediate : the use of ordered paths in d = 2 simplifies the proof of some of the estimates but cannot_be easily_generalized to the the peierls_argument for higher_dimensional ising_models 4 higher_dimensional setting . moreover the combinatorics needed for d > 2 appears at first_sight to be much_more_involved_than the one required in the two dimensional case . on the other_hand the higher_dimensional problem is discussed in specialized books ( like [ 12 , 13 , 14 ] ) , but the topic is approached from a different and more abstract point of view , out of reach for most of the students of a first course in statistical_mechanics . the consequence could_be the ( erroneous ! ) feeling that the peierls_argument can_be conveniently applied only in the case in which , strictly_speaking , it is no more necessary , being the two - dimensional_ising_model exactly_solvable . the purpose of this_paper is to fill this gap by presenting an elementary discussion of the peierls_argument in its more_general d - dimensional version .BR, 64 , … ) . in such cases , more probability lies in exceeding the total blocks to the next higher boundary of power of 2 due_to contributions from library functions . in such cases we can estimate the number of cache lines to next higher power of 2 . ( 4 ) the simulation time of sha ( small ) application for different instruction_cache size combinations varies from 7 to 23 seconds and for larger version it is average 200 seconds . in the proposed approach the cache_size is estimated in time needed by llvm profiler and the script to extract the total_number of unique blocks and dominant block length . this time is less_than 5 seconds in total for small as_well as large version of the same application in mibench . in this way the proposed approach offers fast exploration of the cache design space for given application and processor_architecture .
