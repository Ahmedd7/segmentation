[ 17 ] . hence , the ring model allows for an_intuitive_understanding of the qualitative_features observed in a spin - 1 / 2 trapped_bec with dominant isotopic soc in the weakly_interacting_regime . moreover , the effective 1d hamiltonian given by eqs . ( 6 ) and ( 19 ) leads to a good_quantitative_agreement_with the exact 2d result obtained from eq . ( 4 ) . for example , in fig . 2 we compare the angular_momentum hlz − 1 / 2i in the 1d effective model and the 2d exact equation at κ = 20 . clearly the 1d model recovers both the hv ( 1 / 2 ) - hv ( 3 / 2 ) transition and the hv ( 3 / 2 ) - lattice phase_transition . moreover , although the ring model is not_applicable for large interactions , the form of the uBRγ ( · ) , e . g . non - uniform or discrete , which affect properties of noise induced jumps . finally , it is also possible to consider other shapes of 2d domains , different boundary_conditions or potentials . acknowledgments computer_simulations have_been_performed at computer the academic akademia g ´ orniczo - hutnicza ( krak_´_ow , poland ) under cpu grant mnisw / zeus lokalnie / uj / 052 / 2012 . center cyfronet , 10 - 310 - 210 - 11001010 . 40 . 60 . 811 . 21 . 41 . 61 . 82 ∆ . . . α ∆ 〈 τ 〉 ∆ ( q0 . 9 - q0 . 1 ) 10 - 210 - 11001010 . 40 . 60 . 811 . 21 . 41 . 61 . 82 ∆ . . . α ∆ 〈 τ 〉 ∆ ( q0 . 9 - q0 . 1BRthen the hamiltonian can_be_rewritten in a dimensionless form , h ′ = n x i = 1 [ − 2 ¯ h 2 ∂ 2 ∂ u 2 i + 1 2 ( ui + 1 − ui ) 2 − k cos ( ui + i · 2 π ) ] . by using the following transformations , ui = 1 √ 2 q ¯ h 4 √ 2 ( a † i + ai ) , ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) i , a † h ′ = √ 2 ¯ h − − i ai + 1 2 ) n i = 1 { ( a † x √ 2 ¯ h ( a †BR( y ∼ ) d λ ( y ) = ar ( x ) + br ( x ) . estimate ar ( x ) . since a ( t ) tn is almost decreasing , we have ar ( x ) = ∞ xk = 0 z 2 − k − 1r ≤ ρ ( e , y ) < 2 − kr a ( ρ ( e , y ) ) ρ ( e , y ) n t xf ( y ∼ ) d λ ( y ) ≤ c ∞ xk = 0 a UNK 2 − k − 1r UNK ( 2 − k − 1r ) n z 2 − k − 1r ≤ ρ ( e , y ) < 2 − kr t xf ( y ∼ ) d λ (
