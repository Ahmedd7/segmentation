atomic structure of emfield itself is responsible_for the phenomenon of the interference . let_us_remember that the existence of analogous structure for the fields associated_with other elementary_particles , determining the dynamics of atomic systems , is taken_into_account in phenomenological schrodinger_’ s theory in implicit form by the equation ( 18 ) . for the case of an electomagnetic field the given equation can_be represented in the form , which can_be deduced_from the following picture . the discrete boson -

as observed in the case of the perovskite system - and vice_versa . we contrast our observation to that made in a non - charge / orbital ordered , non - ferroelectric system such as la2nimno6 where the asymmetric hopping in presence of disorder promotes the dielectric_constant . 25 application of magnetic_field , in that case , reduces the disorder and hence the dielectric_constant yielding negative magnetodielectric effect . in our case of a charge / orbital ordered network , on the contrary , the hopping seems to be promoted by an enhanced local alignment of spin structure ( which , in turn , intro6 duces a local disorder within an otherwise 3d antiferromagnetic background ) and / or charge_disproportionation . we , therefore , observe a positive magnetocapacitance effect . this comparsion between the magnetodielectric and magnetocapacitive effects shows that it is not_sufficient to study the influence of magnetic_field on the dielectric_constant alone for a system where dielectric_relaxation takes_place over a wider frequency_range and / or interface contribution too plays a significant_role . 21 , 22 , 28 one_needs to extract the contribution of the purely capacitive part from an_accurate_description of the dielectric_relaxation dynamics to find out the magnetocapacitive effect . in systems where direct_determination of the ferroelectric_polarization is difficult , it is important to determine the influence of magnetic_field on the capacitive component of the dielectric_response to estimate the intrinsic multiferroic coupling of the systems . iv . summary in summary , we show that there is a sizable magin electronic ferroelectric netocapacitance ( ∼ 5 -
