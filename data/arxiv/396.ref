UNK proof of theorem 1 ( i ) . theorem 1 ( i ) is – or should_be – intuitively_obvious , taking_into_account proposition 2 . this proposition says_that the two following models ( a ) and ( b ) : – ( a ) n points i . i . d . uniform in a disk , – ( b ) one point uniform on the circle and , independently , n − 1 i . i . d . uniform inside the disk are equivalent with_respect_to the probability to be in convexBRcm = 0 for all m ∈ z + ∪_{ 0 } , and if a0 = b0 = 0 , then f is zero . finally , the last series in ( 18 ) with the logarithm factor dropped is in sn . in cases 1 – 3 , ∂_ia0 = 0 , a0 ∈ sn − 1 , and ( if κ UNK = 4 ) a1 = 0 . ( we discuss the case κ = 4 after the proof . ) proof . before we prove the theorem , we note_that in items 2 and 3 , the difference of the indicial powers in ( 17 , 18 ) is 2 / κ − ( 1 − 6 / κ ) = r − 1 ∈ z + . therefore , we truncate the first series in ( 17 , 18 ) at m = rBRc1 , k + 1 = k and ci , i + j = 0 for all i = 0 , 1 and j ≥ k + 1 . remark 2 . 8 . min_{ sa1 , s + 1 6 = 0 } ≤ min_{ sa2 , s + 2 6 = 0 } . proof . it_follows from the fact that a is stable . lemma 2 . 9 . if a0 , j − 1 = 0 then β 0 , j ( l ) = 0 . UNK proof . let a0 , j − 1 = 0 . suppose that c0 , j 6 = 0 so c1 , j + 1 = c0 , j − 1 ≥ 0 and by remark 2 β 0 , j ( l ) 6 = 0 . since a0 , j − 1 = 0 and c0 , j 6 = 0 , no minimal generator of degree j is divisible_by x . thus any minimal generator of degree j is of the form ymzn where m ≥ 0 , n ≥ 0 and m + n = j . on the other_hand , as e + ( a ) > j − 1 there is a minimal generator v ∈ g ( l ) e + ( a ) + 1 such that xv . let v = xsytzp where s ≥ 1 and s + t + p = e + ( a ) + 1 >BRif ? x ∈ s ; – if c is of the form ? x = ? y or ? x 6 = ? y , then s = c if ? x , ? y ∈ s ; – s = ¬ bound ( ? x ) if ? x / ∈ s . we now establish the main_result of this section . theorem 2 . let p be a sparql ( bound , = , 6 = c ) or sparql ( bound , 6 = , 6 = c ) pattern . then p is satisfiable if and only if γ ( p ) is nonempty . the only - if direction of theorem 2 is the easy direction and is given by lemma 3 . the if - direction of theorem 2 is given by two similar lemmas : lemma 4 for sparql ( bound , = , 6 = c ) and lemma 5BRis the transition_dipole_moment operator between 0 and 1 in the bare state basis . ijr can_be calculated with the expression 2 = c j 0 2 j = p i r ( 13 ) ij we can interpret the numerical_results in fig . 2 with the energies , populations and decay i , j = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , （ c i 1 μ 2 01 ） 2 rates of the dressed_levels . the triple peaks in the middle originate_from the transitions 6 , 7 , 10 and 11 [ see fig . 2 ( b ) and 2 ( c ) ] . when the tunneling coupling 2t takes a small value , the decay from the levels 2 ψ and 3 ψ are much_slower_than that from 1 ψ and 4 ψ . therefore the triple peaks in the middle are much_narrower_than the others . the energy space , populations and decay_rates of the dressed_levels 2 ψ and 3 ψ grow with an increase of 2t , which results in the increase of splittings between the peaks , the heights and widths of the triple peaks inBR) = ϑ ( ρ , p ) . hence , if r > ϑ ( ρ , p ) for a given ρ , the particular choice v ( x ′ x ) = p ( x ′ ) gives the same bound of theorem 2 , which is thus included as a particular case in theorem 3 . v . an analysis of the bound a . binary channels since most readers are probably familiar with the original elias bound , we first give evidence that the proposed bound is a generalization by showing in detail_how the original bound for binary channels is recovered as a special_case . this shows that , even in the binary case , there is no loss in the use of equation ( 5 ) with the approach based_on ϑ with_respect_to the standard use of the plotkin bound ( 1 ) under composition constraints . in particular , the original bound for binary channels isBR- limited kernel k with bandwidth h > 0 , the previous display gives_us immediately the natural kernel density estimator , which was proposed by fan ( 1991 ) bfh : = f − 1h f k ( h • ) ϕ ε i ∗ µ n for the empirical_measure µ n = pn j = 1 δ yj with dirac_measure δ y in the point y ∈ r . to estimate the linear functional ´ ζ ( x ) f ( x ) dx for suitable functions ζ , say ζ ∈ l1 ( r ) ∩ l ∞ ( r ) , a plug - in approach yields ζ ( x ) bfh ( x ) dx = ζ ( x ) UNK f − 1h f k ( h • ) = UNK f − 1h f k ( − h • ) i ∗ µ n UNK ( x ) dx ϕ ε ( − • ) i ∗ ζ UNK ( x ) µ n ( dx ) . ϕ ε since the regularizing f k ( h • ) degenerates to one as h ↓ 0 , we have to study the mapping properties of the deconvolution operator f − 1 [ 1 / ϕ ε ( − • ) ] . applying a mihlin multiplier theorem , nickl and reiss ( 2012 ) quantified the mapping properties of the fourier_multiplier in a besov scale under_certain assumptions . however , their conditions already exclude simple examples like the poisson_process , which satisfies ( 2 ) even for α = 0 . the target of this sectionBRig − w − + , jg + + w + − , if − w − + , jf † + + w + − , ig − w − + , jg + + w + − , if − w − + , jf † the notation ( + ← → − ) means that all these expressions are supplemented_by the corresponding terms with sign ” + ” substituted by sign ” − ” and vice_versa . current expression . below we consider several properties derived_from the iii . pauli_susceptibility a simple example of an unusual property of noncentrosymmetric_superconductors is shown by the pauli_susceptibility , which can_be found from the paramagnetic_current , as determined_by the eq . ( 30 ) type terms at ω n = 0 , q = 0 . when the band splitting strongly exceeds the superconducting_gap γ kf ≫ ∆ , the susceptibility has a finite value at t = 0 , even for pure s - wave_pairing interaction . for isotropic superconductors it is20 χ p =BRobtain interesting device behavior if the sheet resistivity is roughly below 100 ω . examples_include 139 ω and 69 ω / thz [ 12 ] as_well as 84 ω and 8 . 4 ω / thz [ 13 ] . a lot of effort_has_been directed to producing more pristine_graphene samples and , indeed , suspended_graphene ( minimizing disorder and phonons originating_from the substrate ) , “ cleaned ” in situ by ohmic_heating , has shown impressive mobilities exceeding 105 cm_² / ( v ⋅ s ) , but at the expense of very_limited carrier_concentrations ( bias ) . on the other_hand , huge doping_levels have_been_demonstrated by electrolytic gating , but this led in turn to much_higher scattering . interestingly , the experimental_data lines up within a rather_narrow corridor ( shaded_blue ) indicating that the variance in carrier_concentration roughly trades higher confinement for higher loss in existing graphene samples . however , this should not be considered to indicate a particular dependence of the momentum_relaxation time on carrier_concentration , as the available samples are very_different from one another . nevertheless , it illustrates the current discrepancy_between the experimentally_realizable and the theoretically desired performance of graphene . for metamaterial applications , graphene has to compete_with metals . a 30 - nm film of gold [ 7 ] has an experimentally_measured sheet resistivity of the order of 1 ω ( yellow ( au ) and grey ( ag ) triangles in the fig . 1 ) , two orders of magnitude_smaller_than the theoretical lower_limit of 30 ω for free - standing_graphene at_room_temperature [ 14 ] . the miniaturization advantage of graphene is marginal at_terahertz_frequencies , since the gold_film is still much_thinner_than the free - space wavelength , and other constraints ( e .BRabout the exactness of sequences of translates and sequences of exponentials . corollary 5 . 6 . let { e λ k } k ∈ z be a bessel_sequence of l2 ( e ) . 1 . assume there_exists p > 0 such that φ ≤ p a . e . . if { t λ k φ } k ∈ z is exact , then { e λ k } k ∈ z is exact . 2 . assume there_exist p , p > 0 such that p ≤ φ ≤ p a . e . { t λ k φ } k ∈ z is exact if and only if { e λ k } k ∈ z is exact . in e . then proof . lemma 5 . 4 yields kerde ⊆ kerd φ . if φ is bounded from above and below , then m φ is invertible and so by lemma 5 . 5 , part 2 follows . we can now proof one of the theorems stated in section 3 , a generalization of results
