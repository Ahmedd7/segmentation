( 2012 ) for details ] , ( 3 ) the global terrorism database ii fatalities discussed_above , and ( 4 ) fatalities from the iterate data set 1968 – 1977 . the y - axis of the last two is truncated in order not to obscure the distribution of the tail values with a large range . obviously these are only a small set of examples , but it is clear from the heterogeneity of forms that a single parametric tail model would not be appropriate in all of these_circumstances . this issue is briefly noted in the authors ’ section 5 , andBR, y1 ) did lie_inside the stability region at ( zc1 , zd ( 1 ) , l1 ( zc1 , zd ( 1 ) ) , l2 ( zc1 , zd ( 1 ) ) ) of the corresponding transient_stability model . 0 , yl fig . 5b shows stability region of the transient_stability model in the subspace of the same fast variables when zd jumped from zd ( 2 ) to zd ( 3 ) . likewise , this procedure can_be done successively to verify that the long - term stability model satisfied the condition of consistent attraction . 2 n y s f o δ − 0 . 3158 − 0 . 316 − 0 . 3162 − 0 . 3164 − 0 . 3166 − 0 . 3168 − 0 . 317 0 the trajectory of δ of syn 2 value at the sep of the transient model 1 c x e f o 1 r v 2 4 time ( s ) 6 8 10 1 . 2 1 . 18 1 . 16 1 . 14 1 . 12 1 . 1 1 . 08 0 the trajectory of vr1 of exc 1 value at the sep of the transient model 2 4BR4 1 : v i x r a 1 i . introduction the lhcb_collaboration measured the b0 s decays_into j / ψ and π + π − and observed a pronounced_peak for the f0 ( 980 ) [ 1 ] . simultaneously the signal for the f0 ( 500 ) was_found very_small or non - existent . the belle_collaboration followed suit and reported similar results [ 2 ] , providing absolute rates for the f0 ( 980 ) production with a branching_ratio of the order of 10 − 4 . results of this order of magnitude have_been predicted using light_cone_qcd_sum_rules under the factorization assumption [ 3 ] . the cdf_collaboration corroborated these latter results in [ 4 ] . further_confirmation was provided by the d0_collaboration in [ 5 ] . the lhcb_collaboration has brought much information into the topic and in [ 6 ] results are provided for the ¯ b0 s decay_into j / ψ f0 ( 980 ) followed_by the π + π − decays of the f0 ( 980BRwhere all nodes are equipped_with single_antenna and the solid and dash_lines represent the main and wiretap links , respectively . for_notational_convenience , m cus and n eavesdroppers are denoted_by u = { uii = 1 , 2 , ·_·_· , m } and e = { ejj = 1 , 2 , ·_·_· , n } , respectively . throughout this_paper , we assume the underlay_cognitive_radio , i . e . , when pt is transmitting to pr over a spectrum band , a cu is also allowed to transmit its data to cbs over the same band at the same time as long as the pu ’_s qos is not_affected . in order to protect the pu ’_s qos , the interference received at pr shall beBR, ( 1 ) with t ( θ ) : rn ξ × ( n + n ξ ) such that the following holds_true . ( i ) the dynamics of the controller in the coordinates χ is independent of the parameters θ . ( ii ) the transfer_matrix pcl ( s , θ ) remains invariant . a controller verifying these conditions is said to admit a parameter – independent realization or , in short , that it is a pirc . our interest in this question stems_from model reference adaptive_control ( mrac ) where it is assumed that the parameters of the plant θ are unknown but a parameterized controller that matches a desired reference model is assumed to be known . the scheme is made adaptive replacing in the controller the unknown vector θ by an on – line estimate θ , which is generated via a parameter identifier . the rationale_behind this approach is , clearly , that if the estimated parameters θ converge to their true value θ then — modulo some technical conditions — the adaptive_controller will achieve the control objective . 1 from this perspective it is clear that for a pirc there is no need to make the scheme adaptive ! indeed , we can simply plug – in the parameter – free controller , which will generate the ideal closed – loop transfer_matrix pcl ( s , θ ) , ensuring the control objective . interestingly , this very_simple observation has_been totally overlooked by the adaptive_control community . in particular , a flood ofBRfor fits to other bands . these ‘ dependent ’ fits allow only the component magnitudes to vary , with both components sharing a common cenc UNK_2014_ras , mnras_000 , 1 – 22 0 . 50 . 70 . 91 . 11 . 31 . 5g − i1 - component fits ( n = 106 ) scatter = 0 . 0560 . 50 . 70 . 91 . 11 . 31 . 5g − iunstable fits ( n = 131 ) scatter = 0 . 1330 . 50 . 70 . 91 . 11 . 31 . 5g − iatypical fits ( n = 137 ) scatter = 0 . 052222120191817mg0 . 50 . 70 . 91 . 11 . 31 . 5g − iregular + flagged fits ( n = 200 ) slope = - 0 . 057 ± 0 . 004scatter = 0 . 055 6 j . t . c . g . head et_al . 4 results 4 . 1 initial fitting overview 4 . 1 . 1 sample filtering first , we report the global characteristics of all galaxies in the initial coma sample , and describe the selection of the final analysis sample . except where specifically noted ( i . e . during discussion of internal component gradients )
