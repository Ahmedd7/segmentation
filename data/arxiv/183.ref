temperature techniques [ 9 – 12 ] , a magnificent goal is to explore the domain below the spatial condensation_temperature tc . in this domain , the condensation can_be regarded_as a pure spin - system with the frozen spatial modes . furthermore , when the particle number n is fixed and the magnetization m is conserved , the dimension of the spin - space is given by ( n − m + 2 ) / 2 . thus the dimension is tunable and could_be very_low . in addition to the theoretical interest , the low dimensional spinsystems are very_promising for important applications . for example , a two - dimensional system could_be used as a quantum bit [ 13 , 14 ] . furthermore , a recent_paper shows that the spin oscillation of a highly multi - spatialmode thermodynamical gas can_be described by a theory without_considering the spatial degrees of freedom [ 15 ] . it implies that , the spin - mode can_be decoupled_from the spatial mode under_certain conditions . therefore , the study of a pure spin - system is meaningful . the purpose of this_paper is to ( i ) explore the thermodynamic_properties [ 16 ] ofBRmodel for defining the model for a relational_database and its related tap query implementation as_well as a service interface for uploading simulation descriptions to this database . it is not_yet_clear_whether it can find a place in a single wg . a parallel effort_has_been the proposal for a simpler access standard for small scale simulation , the simple self - describing service protocol ( s3 , [ 15 ] ) . this was a result of an investigation started in the cambridge 2007 interoperability meeting whether “ micro - physics ” simulations as they are sometimes_called require_special_attention . for some time this was covered_by ssa , at_least as far as theory spectra_were concerned . s3 is actually a direct reworking of an older theoretical spectral access protocol [ 20 ] . there were questions in the tig whether s3 might_be incorporated in simdb and / or simdap . in the interoperability meeting in victoria 2010 the decision was made that indeed this should_be possible . the simdm was shown to be able_to incorporate the metadata for s3 - like services , and indeed proposes extensions of that . it was decided that the s3 protocol should_be merged with the simdap protocol , which from then on will be known by the name simulation data access layer ( simdal ) . 42 appendix b uml profile21 the simulation data model uses uml as the language for its specification . this is in accordance_with decisions of the ivoa data model working_group . one advantage of uml is that it is implementation neutral . it is a graphical_language , consisting of “ boxes andBRm ( z ) nx ( dsdz ) x ( dsdz ) 2 φ m ( z ) ) · φ m ( z ) gn 0 2 φ m ( z ) ) − a ( x + φ m ( x ) ( s ) ) UNK · φ m ( z ) n0 ( dz ) UNK 3 ( t , x , x ) UNK + sm 4 ( t , x , x ) . e − ( ia + b ) − e − ( ia ′ + b ′ ) ≤ e − be − ia − e − ia ′ + b − b ′ x ∈ rd 2 ( t , x , x ) − s0 4 ( t , · , x ) − s0 1 ( t , · , x ) − e − is 0 3 ( t , · , x ) − s0 e0h sup 1 ( t , · , x ) k ∞ i + sup t ≤ t sm 3 ( t , · , x ) k ∞ i + e0h sup t ≤ t ksm for any a , a ′ ∈ r , b , b ′ ≥ 0 , sup e0 [ ·_·_· ] of the first_term on the right of ( 4 . 4 ) is less_than or equal to 2 ( t , x , x ) i e0h sup t ≤ t ke − ism 4 ( t , · , x ) k ∞BR) ( 56 ) ( 57 ) ( 58 ) ∀ k ∈ { k ∈ kt dk > 1 } ( f ) = 0 , a ak sk ∈ s ( ok ) , ( 60 ) ∆ pg , k = max ( 0 , pg , k − p g , k ) , ∀ ( g , k ) ∈ g × kt \_{ 0 } ( 61 ) ∆ mg , k = max ( 0 , p g , k − pg , k ) , ∀ ( g , k ) ∈ g × kt \_{ 0 } , ( 62 ) ∀ k ∈ kt \_{ 0 } ( 59 ) where equation ( 59 ) enforces that the activation of flexible_loads is not_accounted as a recourse action . the set s ( ok ) is an approximation of the set s ( ok ) of the system states that respect operational limits . for the test instance presented in this_paper , this set is defined using a linear constraint over the upper_limits of active production levels and over the active consumption of loads : k s ( ok ) ≡ ns ∈ s UNK UNK UNK xg ∈ g p g + xd ∈ c UNK pd + ∆ pd UNK < co , ( 63 ) where c is a constant that can_be estimated byBRof co is very_efficient below the co freeze - out temperature , with a sticking efficiency close to unity based_on experiments ( 12 ) , and a co condensation - based dust_growth mode may thus be key to explaining these observations . protoplanetary_disks have evolving radial and vertical temperature_gradients , with a warmer surface where co remains in the gaseous state throughout the disk , even as it is frozen in the cold , dense region beyond the midplane snow_line ( 13 ) . this means that the midplane snow_line important for planet_formation constitutes a smaller portion of a larger condensation surface . because the bulk of the co_emission comes_from the disk surface_layers , this presents a challenge for locating the co midplane snow_line . its location has_been observationally identified toward only one system , the disk around hd_163296 , based_on ( sub -

lagrange system is not elliptic or of some other hyperbolic type . so , we call the euler - lagrange system hyperbolizable if , after a possible gauge_fixing , it can_be shown to be equivalent to a constrained hyperbolic system in a way that we make_precise below . from now on , we require that for a classical field_theory the lagrangian l is chosen such that its euler - lagrange_equations are hyperbolizable . we_shall see later in sec . 4 , that many relativistic_field_theories of physical interest are in fact hyperbolizable . consider the gauge fixed euler - lagrange system , whose equation form is ( el ⊕ cg , f ∗ ⊕ m eg ) . it is hyperbolizable if it equivalent ( in the sense of sec . appendix b . 1 )BR: q ) = UNK log l ( hpx ) UNK p − UNK log l ( hqx ) UNK p . ( 12 ) if we are comparing many different q to a single p , as we will do for our case , the first_term is a constant that normalizes the expectation_value of the likelihood of hq ( the likelihood that x are drawn_from q ) . this means that in bayesian theory , this first_term must_be related to the evidence . in our case , we_want to derive a confidence_interval around the best - fit parameters by testing how_much the clustering of the j changes as we vary theBRa wide parameter range ( see fig . 4 ) , the selfconsistent relaxation_rate in the bad_metal is many_orders of magnitude_slower_than any other relevant timescale , so that the nearly localized metal cannot_be distinguished from true mbl by small - system numerical_studies . such a nearly localized metallic_phase should exhibit many of the features of a many - body localized phase coupled to a bath , such as a “ soft gap ” in the spectra of local operators19 . moreover , γ can_be related to quantities such as the dc_conductivity . we predict that , in the nearlylocalized regime , the low - temperature dc_conductivity vanishes with a faster - than - activated temperature_dependence , viz .
