one is the case that the actual length of ordered_moments is larger_than was reported by neutron experiments [ 8 ] , and the other is due_to the possible contribution of supertransferred hyperfine_interaction via ligand oxygen_atoms intervening si and cu . next ,BRspectral bandwidth of 72 nm [ 22 ] . directly behind the amplification stages the laser_beam was split_into_two_parts , an alignment beam and a probe_beam . the alignment pulses can_be compressed or stretched ( negatively chirped ) with an external compressor continuously to pulse_durations ranging_from 40 fs to 520 ps . the probe_pulses were compressed to 30 fs using the standard grating based compression setup . since both beams were generated_by the same laser system they were inherently synchronized . both beams were incident on a 60 cm - focal - length lens , parallel to each_other , with a transverse distance of 10 mm . the foci were overlapped in space and time in the molecular_beam in the center of the velocity - map - imaging_spectrometer . the relative timing between the two pulses was adjusted by a motorized linear translation_stage . in our theoretical_description , we solved the timedependent schr_ö_dinger_equation [ 23 ] starting in the fieldfree rotational ground_state and using the experimental temporal_profile of the laser_intensity . the angular part of the interaction potential between the molecules and the nonresonant laser_field , − i ( t )BR, ] n __ _ _ ψ ξ ξ _____ 1111i _ _ _ ξ ξ ξ ___ _ 11tttfn _______ _ _ _ _ _ _ xxxfxff  ___ _ ff _ __ r _ ( 1 ) ( ) : [ , . . . , ] nff _ _ f __  x __ : ff __ x _ _ : nf _ _ fr _ _ : n _ _ xxr _ _______ 11tttfn _______ ___ _ _ _ ___ _ _ ___ xxxxfxfff  ___ ___ : ff __ __ _______ _____ 11tttn _______ _____ _ _  _ _ _ _ ___ xxxxfxffff  ___ ___ nf _ _ fr _   coefficient matrix in eqn . 3 . 6 so as to incorporate information on these gradients through previous estimates . thus and are replaced respectively by the following approximations : ( 3 . 7a ) ( 3 . 7b ) note_that we have used ito_’_s formula whileBR− 1 = 1 . let_us_consider og3 + , starting with the 3 - dimensional top - cell , we have : since each stratification can_be represented_by an on - shell diagram , we can illustrate the − 1 + 3 − 6 + 5 = 1 ( 2 . 63 ) – 23 – ( a ) ( b ) 123412341234 enumeration of the elements in each dimension as follows : .
