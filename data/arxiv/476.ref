( 9 ) are not_sufficient but one additional exponent related to the control parameter , the driving_force f , is needed . in the vicinity of the depinning_threshold ft we can introduce two exponents describing the ‚Äú order parameter ‚Äù , which is the velocity v of the center of mass , and the correlation_length_Œæ : v ‚àº ( f ‚àí ft ) Œ≤ Œæ ‚àº ( f ‚àí ft ) ‚àí ŒΩ . ( 13 ) ( 14 ) the correlation_length_Œæ gives the typical length of segments that rearrange during the avalanche - like motion close to the threshold ; the typical time scale for this segment motion is t Œæ ‚àº Œæ z . we can use one of these exponents , e . g . the correlation_length_exponent ŒΩ , to obtain from the equilibrium scaling_relation w ( t , l ) = t Œ∂ / zg ( t / tz l ) ( 15 ) with a scaling function g ( x ) ( with g ( 0 ) ‚âà 1 and g ( x ) ‚àº x ‚àí Œ∂ / z for x UNK 1 ) , which underlies eq .

( b ) phase_diagram at finite 4 . conclusion we have investigated the ordered_phases in the half - filled holstein - hubbard_model , using the dynamical mean - field_theory , which is reliable in high dimensions , with a continuous time quantum_monte_carlo impurity_solver . in particular , we have revealed the behavior of the transition_temperatures of sc and af when Œª , u and œâ 0 are comparable to the electronic bandwidth w . we have shown deviations_from the anti - adiabatic description ( the hubbard_model ) at finite œâ 0 , and discussed the accuracy of the effective polaron description for each phase . we have also obtained the phase_diagram around ueff = 0 at nonzero temperatures , showing that the paramagnetic_metallic ( insulating ) phase appears when u and Œª are small ( large ) enough . the authors_would_like_to thank t . kariyado , t . oka , m . tezuka and aBRerror_estimates are proved for the finite_element method both in the bulk - surface energy norm and the l2 - norm . the analysis is not restricted to linear finite elements and a piecewise planar reconstruction of the surface , but also covers the discretization with higher_order elements and a higher_order surface reconstruction . 1 . introduction . coupled bulk - surface or bulk - interface partial_differential_equations arise in many_applications , e . g . , in multiphase fluid_dynamics [ 17 ] and biological_applications [ 2 ] . in this_paper , we consider a coupled bulk - interface advectiondiffusion problem . the problem arises in models describing the behavior of soluble surface active agents ( surfactants )BRŒª ‚Üí b √ó Œª , Œ∏ br ( x √ó Œª ) Œ∏ brk ( Œ∏ ) ‚âÉ brxprb ( Œ∏ ) ‚äó k ( Œ∏ ) brk ( Œ∏ ) where Œ∑ Œª is the generic point of b √ó Œª and where the horizontal homomorphisms are specializations and the vertical homomorphisms are base changes . proof . by applying [ lia13 , prop . 3 . 1 . 1 ] , which holds for any base field of characteristic 0 , to the generic_fibre x Œ∑ , we can choose a finite extension k ‚Ä≤ of k ( b ) such that the left vertical homomorphism is an_isomorphism once k ( Œª ) ( b ) is linearly_disjoint_from k ‚Ä≤ over k ( b ) . the field k ‚Ä≤ is a finitely_generated extension of k , let k ‚Ä≤ be the algebraic_closure of k in k ‚Ä≤ . any finite extension l of k linearly_disjoint_from k ‚Ä≤ / k is then linearly_disjoint_from k ‚Ä≤ / k , and therefore l ( b ) is linearly_disjoint_from k ‚Ä≤ over k ( b ) . the finite_¬¥_etale_morphism p1 √ó spec ( k ) spec ( k ‚Ä≤ ) ‚Üí p1 defines a generalised hilbertian subset hil1 of p1 such that for each Œª ‚àà hil1 the left vertical homomorphism is an_isomorphism . it_suffices_to make_sure_that the two horizontal specializations are isomorphisms for Œ∏ and Œª in certain suitable generalised hilbertian subsets that are going to be /_/____ / / 12 yongqi liang chosen . first we show this for spx ‚Üí b , prb ( Œ∏ ) , and for the lower horizontal homomorphism it is exactly the same_argument applied for x √ó Œª instead of x . to simplify_notation , we replace prb (BR6 feature maps and a 22 kernel for each feature map . the third layer c3 is convolution layer with 16 feature maps and a 66 kernel for each feature map . the fourth layer s4 is a subsampling layer with 16 feature maps and a 22 kernel for each feature map . the fifth layer c5 a convolution layer with 120 feature maps and a 66 kernel for each feature map . the sixth layer f7 is a fully_connected_layer . in this experimental study the mnist_dataset is trained with the above_mentioned convnet architecture , using 2000 training_samples and 1000 testing samples . the number of training iterations is set to 20 . the learning_rate used in the backpropagation_algorithm is 0 . 0001 . 2 results of demo and discussion experimental_results are available_publicly 1 . from the results of this experimental study , it is obvious that as the number of training iterations increases , the accuracy rate increases and error_rate decreases . for example , after 20 iterations the accuracy rate converges to 96 . 5 % and error_rate converges to 3 . 4 % .
