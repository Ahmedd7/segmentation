hence d ( [ f ] ) = [ f ⊗ l o ic ( o , eo ) ] . in particular we_deduce that if e ′ is any composition factor of the g - equivariant local system f ⊗ l o eo , then ic ( o , e ′ ) occurs in the modular reduction of f . the following proposition is a crucial_tool for identifying modular cuspidal_pairsBR= tatb and p0 = ( 1 − ta ) ( 1 − tb ) it easily follows_from 0 ≤ pi ≤ 1 that the eigenvalues satisfy 0 ≤ ta , tb ≤ 1 . for a derivation employing the generating_function for counting_statistics , see [ 23 , 24 ] . , ( s2 ) UNK b ta UNK p0 = det , eigenstates of the total spin operator that carry minimal entanglement are the spin_singlet state with a doubly_occupied orbital and the fully_polarized two - orbital triplet_states , s UNK ∝ ( ↑_↓ UNK − ↓_↑ UNK ) ψ ψ UNK , t σ UNK ∝ σ σ UNK ( ψ 1 ψ 2 UNK − ψ 2 ψ 1 UNK ) . since s UNK and t σ UNK are expressible by a single_slater_determinant , their partitioning by an interactions - free barrier will also result in a generalized binomial_distribution , regardless of the barrier - induced overlap UNK a tb UNK . if the scattering is spin - independent , then the same applies to the non - spin - polarized component of aBRsolid friction_force between the members of the pair depends_on_whether they slide relative to one another at the contact or not . the velocity of grain i relative to j is , ~ λ k ≡ ~ ∆ k + 1 2 ( ~ ω i + ~ ω j ) × ~ rk + 1 2 ( ~ ω i − ~ ω j ) × ~ ρ k ( 1 ) where ~ ∆ k = ~ vi − ~ vj is the relative centre of mass velocity of the two grains , ~ ω i and ~ ω j are , respectively , the angular_velocities of the two grains around their centres of mass , ~ rk = ~ rij − ~ rji is the vector from the centre of mass of grain i to the centre of mass of grain j and ~ ρ k = ~ rij + ~ rji . note_that ~ ρ k = 0 for identicalBR) and ( c , d ) with a < c < d < b ( see [ 10 ] ) . now , we can give the explicit_description of the coefficients of pf λ ( a ) : theorem 1 . the λ - pfaffian of a defined by the recurrence_relation ( 2 ) equals pf λ ( a ) = xm ∈ m ( 2n ) ( − 1 ) cross ( m ) λ cross ( m ) + nest ( m ) n yi = 1 am2i − 1m2i . since every term in the expansion of the weighted_sum is indexed_by matchings , we will give an_explicit bijection_between the pairs of matchings corresponding to terms in the equation ( 2 ) . in this sense , our proof gives another combinatorial proof of the dodgson condensation formula by putting λ = 1 and appealing to the fundamental relation_between pfaffians and determinants ( see [ 6 , 7 , 12 ] ) , which is also the λ = 1 case of proposition 4 , but our case is much_more_general . the rest of this_paper is organized_as_follows . in section 2 we give a purely_combinatorial proof of theorem 1 which uses an_involution . in section 3 we state and proof several properties of λ - pfaffiansBRaia ’_s seven euv_channels and three formats ( intensity , running difference and base difference ) . additionally , to benefit_from stereoscopic views , two other sets of movies are made of aia_193 a and stereo - a or - b euvi_195 a pairs . it is also important to follow lcpfs with_respect_to the development of the associated flares as captured in soft x - ray_light_curves . to accommodate goes soft x - ray_light_curves in the movies , we further shrink the images to 7682 pixels , although images of 10242 pixels are used when measuring lcpfs ( § 4 ) . lcpfs are usually found in running difference movies , but base difference movies are useful for isolating long - lasting dimming , which may correlate_with the spatial_extent of the cme ( thompson et_al . 2000a ) . intensity movies ,
