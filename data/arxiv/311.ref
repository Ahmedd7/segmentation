( 2006 ) and takeda_et_al . ( 2007 ) . figure 3 summarizes the stellar properties of teff , r ⋆ , and log g . the histograms show the distribution of the parameters and their associated uncertainties . each of the histograms are divided_into 30 bins and have the same y - axis scale for ease of comparison . the distribution of teff lies mostly between 4000 – 6500 k ; a reflection of the f – g – k target selection which dominates rv exoplanet_host_stars . the distribution of the teff uncertainties peaks at ∼ 50 k which is ∼ 1 % of the typical teff value . as described in section 3 , the stellar_radius plays a key_role in determining the uncertainty in the hz boundaries . the stellar_radii histogram shows that dwarf_stars dominate as hosts of the confirmed_exoplanets with a distribution peaking_at_∼ 1r_⊙ . the uncertainty distribution peaks at ∼ 0 . 04r ⊙ and thus the typical radius uncertainty for this group of host_stars is ∼ 4 % . the distribution of log g values shown in figure 3 is also indicative of the dominance of dwarf host_stars in the 4 stephen r . kane fig . 3 . — histograms of the stellar_parameters ( left_columnBR) ⊳ α − 1 ( h1 ) ) ⊳ ( n ⊳ h2 ) ( 1 ) = ν ( ( n ⊳ h2 ) ( 0 ) ) ⊗ m ⊳ ( α − 1 ( h1 ) α − 1 ( ( n ⊳ h2 ) ( 1 ) ) ) = ν ( n ( 0 ) ⊳ α − 1 ( h1 ) ) ⊗ m ⊳ ( n ( 1 ) α − 1 ( h2 ) ) = ν ( n ( 0 ) ⊳ h1 ⊗ ( µ − 1 ( m ) ⊳ n ( 1 ) ) ⊳ h2 = ( ν ( n ( 0 ) ) ⊗ µ − 1 ( m ) ⊳ n ( 1 ) ) ⊳ h = cm , n ( m ⊗ n ) ⊳ h , where in the fifth_equality the twisted yetter - drinfel_’_d condition has_been_used . we now show that cm , n is h - colinear : indeed , ( ρ n ⊗ m ◦ cm , n ) ( m ⊗ n ) = ρ n ⊗ m ( ν ( n ( 0 ) ) ⊗ µ − 1 ( m ) ⊳ n ( 1 ) ) = ( ν ( n ( 0 ) ) ( 0 ) ⊗ ( µ − 1 ( m ) ⊳ n ( 1 ) ) ( 0 ) ) ⊗ νBRz ) = f ( z + it ) . 2 UNK provides an extension of the kernel k to s × s . on example 4 . 8 . for later use we record here how frohlich ’_s theorem applies in the linear case . let v be a locally_convex_space and h · , · i : v × v → c be a continuous positive_semidefinite_hermitian form . then k ( v , w ) = hw , vi is a positive_definite_kernel and hk is identified with a subspace of the v ♯ of antilinear continuous functionals . the continuity of the kernel k implies that the antilinear_map v → hk , v 7 → kv is continuous . for any continuous operator l : v → v , the formula l λ : = − λ ◦ l defines by restriction to dl : = { λ ∈ v ♯ l λ ∈ hk } an unbounded closed operator lk : dl → hk . if there_exists l ∗ : v → v with hv , lwi = hl ∗ v , wi for v , w ∈ v then lkv = k − l ∗ v for v ∈ v .
