defining the cover - width of a hypergraph and stating some of its properties . i . 1 cover - width of hypergraphs let h “ pv , eq be a hypergraph . let σ “ pv1 , . . . , vnq be an ordering of vertices of this hypergraph . in the context of this_paper , this ordering is called a gao . in traditional graph theory , database , and graphical_model applications , an ordering of vertices of a hypergraph is often_called an “ elimination order . ” we use gao instead of elimination order because sometimes we will need our gao to be a particular elimination order or the reverse of an elimination order in the traditional sense . for any hypergraph g , let vpgq denote its vertex set , and epgq denote its edge set . the union of two hypergraphs . if g is a hypergraph and v is one of its vertices , then g ´ v denotes the hypergraph obtained from g by removing v from vpgq and fromBR, v k , no sticky solution exists , not even 13 x 1 x 2 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 1 d k figure 5 : modifying the initial_data in figure 4 in order to obtain a continuous distribution of initial velocities . left : the initial speed of the particles xk , xk approaches the same limit as k →_∞ and ¯ xk , x k → 0 . right : a point mass is replaced_by a continuous distribution on a ball bk , choosing the initial velocity so that after a short time all the mass is concentrated at one single point . locally in time . by the above construction , the same conclusion holds for an initial distribution of mass with smooth density ¯ ρ ( x ) . = c · ∞ xk = 1 ψ k ( x ) + ψ k ( x ) ! ∞ xk = 1 and continuous initial velocity_field ¯ v ( · ) here c > 0 is a normalizing_constant , chosen so that r ¯ ρ ( x ) dx = 1 . in an entirely similar_way , one can modify the initial_data in example 3 and obtain theorem 2 . in any dimension n ≥ 2 there_exists an initial_datum ( ¯ ρ , ¯ v ) such that the system c ( irn ) is the density of a probability ( 1 . 1BR. ziegler , “ new electromagnetic mode in graphene , ” phys . rev . lett . , vol . 99 , p . 016803 , 2007 .
