( i ) v ∗ is a weak probabilistic fixed_point of the sequence ( ii ) let v be a weak probabilistic fixed_point of the sequence proof is given appendix a . 5 . it is obvious that we need more assumptions to analyze the asymptotic_behavior of the iterates of the random operator UNK tn and establish the connection to the fixed_point theorem 4 . 3 . suppose the random operator UNK tn satisfies the assumptions 4 . 1 - 4 . 4 . then the we summarize the above discussion in the following theorem . of the deterministic operator . , then v is a fixed_point of t . n ≥ 1 UNK UNK tn UNK UNK UNK tn n ≥ 1 UNK . following three statements are equivalent : ( i ) v is a fixed_point of t , ( ii ) v is a strong probabilistic fixed_point of ( iii ) v is a weakBRγ be a two - player strategic_game . the strategy_profile ( µ ∃ , µ ∀ ) is an equilibrium ( in mixed_strategies ) in γ if for each_player p ∈ { ∃ , ∀ } , up ( µ p , µ ¯ p ) ≥ up ( µ ′ p , µ ¯ p ) for each mixed_strategy µ ′ p of p . a strategy in an equilibrium is called an equilibrium strategy . the minimax theorem ( see theorem 2 below ) shows that every finite , two - player , zero - sum game γ has an equilibrium . nash [ 11 ] later generalized this result to arbitrary finite strategic_games , and this type of equilibrium has henceforth been associated_with his_name . since in this_work we_shall only require the minimax theorem , we_shall not use the term nash_equilibrium despite the fact that it_seems to be more common in the literature on game_theory . it is not hard to see that if γ has multiple_equilibria , they all return the same expected_utility to eloise . we call this the value of the game ,BRrayleigh wave velocity , along with sub - rayleigh and fast intersonic fronts . slow fronts were also reported to propagate at soft elastomer - roughened glass spherical 2d contacts [ 5 ] by tracking optically markers positioned on the surface of the elastomer . brorman et_al . [ 6 ] extended such studies to micro - structured elastomer surfaces in the form of hexagonal arrays of cylindrical micro - pillars in contact with glass_slides , and found again a similar phenomenology . during stick phases , slow_slip precursors were also observed well before macroscopic slippage occurs [ 2 ] . in all these experiments , a single physical_quantity is measured , either the real area of contact directly_related to the local normal_stress , or the local interfacial stress using displacement measurements . in a recent_work [ 7 ] , ben - david and fineberg provided both types of measurement in a system treated_as a 1d interface . using an array of strain_gauges sensors distributed directly above the interfacial plane , these authors reported strong_correlations_between the characteristics of the fronts and the ratio of the measured tangential to normal local stresses . for an extended 2d contact , simultaneous_measurements of both pressure and tangential interfacial fields is still_lacking and out of reach using ben - david and fineberg ’_s approach . in addition , it remains_unclear what physical_mechanism underlies the existence of slip precursors in the stick phase and their velocity , despite numerous theoretical as_well as numerical works [ 8 – 14 ] . in this_letter , we take_advantage of recent_developments in micro - milling techniques to design model elastomer multi - contact surfaces [ 15 ] . these consist of thousands of spherical_caps distributed on top of
