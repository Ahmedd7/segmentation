and both appear accurate , manifesting appropriate magnitudes and scaling_behavior . since the formalism is efficient as_well as accurate , it may become productive in cluster ionization spectroscopy . at the same time , it is interesting and important to explore theoretically the basis of its_applicability to size - quantized cluster systems , as_well as the general subject of the transition from atomic and molecular photoionization profiles to those of bulk surface photoemission . we appreciate c . stark ’_s contribution at the initial stage of this project , and support by the nsf and the usc undergraduate_research associates program . 4 table 1 . appearance energies
