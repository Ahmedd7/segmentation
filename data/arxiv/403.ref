for by any of the individuals . while there seems to be no integrity_constraint directly causing this paradox , we may represent the profile in the example above as a situation in which the three individual ballots are bound by a budget_constraint ¬ ( pa ∧ pb ∧ pc ) . even if all individuals are giving acceptance to two issues each , the result of the aggregation is the unfeasible acceptance of all three issues . as can_be deduced_from our previous_discussion , every instance of the mep gives_rise_to several instances of a binary aggregation paradox for definition 1 . to see this , it is sufficient to find an integrity_constraint that is satisfied by all 14 individuals and not by the outcome of the aggregation . 3 on the other_hand , every instance of definition 1BRthat denotes the value of the solution that the algorithm outputs . together this implies that e [ alg ] = o ( op t ) . each one of the next two_lemmas handles one of ) and that e [ alg ¯ s ] = o ( op t ) , where 1 k + 1 ) . k + 1 k + 1 k + 1 n n n 1 1 1 1 1 1 n n n n ′ k + 1 k + 1 k + 1 ) . 1 1 . the required approximation ratio follows since the value of the optimal_solution is n ′ . those cases . lemma 4 . 7 e [ algs ] = o ( op t let ci , r be the random_variable that denotes the probability that player i is allocated proof : an item at round r . observe_that if player i is easy to satisfy then forBRis continuously buffered during this time . after 80 sec the concentration quickly reduces to slightly_less_than the normal physiological level . still there is a local potassium deficit and what we call backward buffering , i . e . , the release of potassium from the glial_cells sets in . it is much_slower_than the uptake , because it is driven by a far smaller deviation of the potassium concentration from physiological resting conditions of the glial cell . so as for diffusion the forward and the backward process do_not actually happen simultaneously . similar to the above explanation of slowBR92 s resolution proton number density np , bulk velocity vsw , and proton temperature . this is separated_into parallel tk and perpendicular t ⊥ temperatures by comparison with the local magnetic_field from the magnetic_field investigation [ 33 ] . only solar_wind data is used , and measurements either in the magnetosphere or contaminated_by terrestrial foreshock are removed . we also require the uncertainties in the plasma measurements to be less_than 10 % . here we ask if kinetic effects , such as plasma_heating and temperature_anisotropy , are related to the turbulent character of the solar_wind . to this end , an extension of the kolmogorov - yaglom law [ 34 , 35 ] to timestationary incompressible homogeneous magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd )BR5 , 6 ] but the cfts are non - interacting . this makes the btz - cft_duality suspect . in this essay we will illustrate the limitations two decoupled cfts have on the description of the bulk physics and discuss its implications for the proposed btz - cft_duality . the dictionary between ads and cft to equate ads and cft one_needs the dictionary between_them . the first entry of this dictionary is the definition of the “ boundary ” itself . asymptotically_ads_spacetimes permit the fefferman - graham_expansion [ 7 ] of their metrics ds2 = dr2 + dxadxb + o ( e − 2r ) .

often stacks are defined as sheafs of groupoids for this reason . 3 . 9 . in practice , we can think of a general stack as an equivalence_class [ g ] of a lie_groupoid g under morita_equivalence , the lie_groupoid taking the place of an atlas for the stack . presently , we explain these concepts . we refer the reader to [ 34 ] for a more_detailed_exposition of these_issues . for example , the translation groupoid g = m UNK g is defined as the groupoid whose manifold of objects ( homeomorphic to m ) are the points m ∈ m , and whose manifold of arrows (BRplanets that are locked or not is roughly that between spectral class k and m . thus , for the purposes of this_paper , we divide single stars into “ bright ” ( spectral class k and earlier ) and “ dim ” ( class m ) . the class of dim stars includes other types of objects not shining by nuclear_fusion , such as solitary white and brown_dwarfs , despite the problematic nature of having a habitable_zone around these objects [ 11 ] . finally , since at this point , our_knowledge_about planet_formation in multiple star systems is rather_limited [ 12 ] , we treat these systems as a separate third category “ multiple ” . the simbad_database provides not only positions for all stars within 40 pc of the solar_system , but for most , the spectral class of each star as_well . when a spectral class is not listed , the object is placed in the “ dim ” category . this classification leaves the possibilities of using all star systems in the volume under_consideration , or_else focusing purely on more sun - like “ bright ” stars . if the latter is used , the degree distribution of these stars is different than that for all systems , as reflected in figure 2 . using only bright_stars lends_itself to more accuracy . because dimmer stars tend not to be observed , they are underrepresented in surveys of the local stellar neighborhood , especially for larger_distances from the solar_system . this is seen directly in the stellar number density within the
