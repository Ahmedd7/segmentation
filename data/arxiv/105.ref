( 21 ) , we find that the latter is given by : h σ z ( t ) i = a cos ( ω zbt ) , a = r re { φ + ( x ) ¯ φ − ( x ) } dx . ( 22 ) r ρ ( x ) dx it is now clear that for solitons of branch ( a ) , with an odd_parity of the product φ + φ − , one_gets a = 0 and , thus , a zero mean_value of h σ zi . here we should note_that although solitons of branch ( a ) are similar to beating dark - dark_solitons observed_experimentally in [ 7 , 8 ] , there_exists a substantial_difference : the breathing behavior of all states presented_herein is characterized_by an oscillation_frequency equal to the nonlinear zb frequency , corresponding to solitons in different bands . the bottom three rowsBRtel . : + 81 - 6 - 6850 - 6504 . fax_: + 81 - 6 - 6850 - 6407 . email_address_: nakanishi @ aquarius . mp . es . osaka - u . ac . jp ( akitaka nakanishi ) preprint_submitted_to solid_state_communications may 16 , 2014 [ 1 ] where d5 configuration is more stable due_to the hund_’_s_rule in the highspin state , or ( 2 ) charge excitation in s1 or d9 electronic configurations [ 2 ] where the closed shell of s2 and d10 configuration is more stable than the unpaired s1 or d9 configurations . in this_letter , we_propose the large negative effective u is possible for hole - doped cualo2 , agalo2 and aualo2 in which charge excitation or charge_disproportionation in d9 configuration is dominant_mechanism for the negative effective u system . for cualo2 , agalo2 and aualo2 , we calculated the total energy of the different charged states , e ( n − 1 ) , e ( n ) and e ( n + 1 ) , and estimated the u = e ( n + 1 ) + e ( n − 1 ) − 2e ( n ) . we find that they have large negative effective u which are induced by the charge excitation in cu2 + ( d9 ) , ag2 + ( d9 ) and au2 + ( d9 ) electronic configuration . based_on the electron - phonon_interaction and the negative effective u , we_propose the general design rule to realize the high - tc_superconductor combined ab_initio_electronic_structure calculation and quantum monte_carlo_simulation by using the negative effective u hubbard_model . 2 . general rule of negative effective u mechanism by the electronic_excitations based_on the periodic tables ofBR109_1010_1011 1012_1013_1014_1015 1016 fa  gev  figure 2 : neutralino and axion relic_abundance from the susy_dfsz axion model versus pw scale fa for the sua benchmark point . angle θ i decreases . values of θ i ∼ 1 are found around fa ∼ 2 ×_1011_gev for both ξ = 0 and 1 . in this entire region with fa ∼ 109 − 1012_gev , we expect from natural_susy that the relic higgsino abundance lies at the standard freezeout value , comprising about 5 - 10 % of the total dark_matter density , while axions would comprise 90 - 95_% of the abundance . thus , over the commonly_considered range of fa , we expect mainly axion cold_dark_matter from natural_susy , along with a non - negligible_fraction of higgsino - like wimps . 3 . 6 detection of axions and higgsinos in fig . 4 , we show the spin - independent higgsino - proton_scattering rate in pb as calculated_using isares [ 27 ] . the result is rescaled by a factor ξ = ω std h2 / 0 . 11 to account for the fact that the ez1 local relic_abundance might_be far less_than the usually_assumed value ρ local ≃ 0 . 3 gev /_cm3 , as suggested long_ago by bottino et_al .
