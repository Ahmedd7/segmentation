( iii ) the emission is very narrowly beamed along v and v corotates . it_follows that one can calculate the observed time - dependent luminosity by integrating the radiation power ( at fixed time ) over d3r and sending each emitted_photon into χ , with cos χ = ω · v , and also assigning to each emitted_photon a phase_shift φ . the phase φ consists of a time_delay from theBR.
