( 3 ) has_been considered by_many_authors , starting with henri_poincar_´_e in 1906 [ 9 , 10 , 32 , 33 ] ; for a brief revue see rohrlich [ 7 ] . a simple way to calculate it is as follows . first consider a charged sphere in inertial_motion . we assume the charge is all situated in a thin_shell on the surface of the sphere . in the rest_frame , the tension in the field at any point on the outerBR[ ev ] 987654321050403020100 – 10 – references augustin , j . , muller , b . , & greiner , w . 1989 , z . phys . d 14 , 312 badnell , n . et_al . 2014 , the iron project – the opacity project , http_:_/ /_cdsweb . u - strasbg . fr / topbase / energy . html bania , t . m . et_al . 1997 , apj suppl . ser . 113 , 353 balser , d . s . , bania , t . m . , rood , r . t . , & wilson , tBRrate which closely_approximates the dense_coding capacity at small photon numbers , and is also good_enough to outperform the ( one - way ) classical_capacity of the noiseless quantum channel . the paper is structured as follows . in sec . ii , we first give a thorough theoretical_description of the system_under_consideration and the quantum_langevin_equations ( qles ) are derived and linearized around the semiclassical steady_state . in sec . iii , we study the steady_state of the system and quantify the entanglement_between the output optical modes by using the logarithmic_negativity . in sec . iv , we show_how the optomechanical source is able_to approach the capacity of dense_coding at_low_energies . finally , our_conclusions are given in sec . v . ii . description and dynamics of the optomechanical_system we start with a sketch of the system as shown in fig . 1 . a perfectly_reflecting membrane with mass m is placed in the middle of a cavity formed by two fixed mirrors separated from each_other by a distance 2l . two strong_coupling fields with amplitudes  r and  l and frequencies ω 0r and ω 0l , respectively , are sent into the cavity through the partially transmitting right and left mirrors . the right and left subcavities are assumed to be linearly_coupled to the displacement of the membrane with coupling_constants g0r and g0l , respectively . hence the system ’_s time - dependent hamiltonian takes the form [ 35 ] h =  ω ra † a +  ω lb † b + g0ra † aBRtemperature_anisotropies are a random gaussian field , the three - point correlation , h θ ℓ 1 θ ℓ 2 θ ℓ 3i , vanishes . as described in eq . ( 38 ) , the lensing , however , induces mode - couplings in the cmb_anisotropies . the isw - lensing correlation then generates the three - point correlation of lensed_cmb anisotropies as [ 45 ] ℓ 1 ℓ 2 ( 45 ) c θ θ he θ ℓ 1e θ ℓ 2e θ ℓ 3i = ( 2 π ) 2 δ ( ℓ 1 + ℓ 2 + ℓ 3 ) [ c θ φ ℓ 1 ⊙ φ ℓ 2 + ( perms ) ] + o ( da2 ) . the isw - lensing correlation generated_by density_perturbations on large_scale , c θ φ , can_be used to probe the late_time evolution of the large - scale structure [ 45 , 100 , 135 ] . the cosmic_strings at late_time of the universe also produce the temperature bispectrum through c θ φ [ 134 ] , but contributions from the curl mode vanish since the cross_correlation of temperature and the curl mode is an odd - parity quantity . the curl mode generated_by the cosmic_strings would_beBRcomponent function fs an additive structure f = pk depends_on a small ds number of predictors . clearly , m3 subsumes m2 as a special_case . in section 3 we show m2 gives slowest minimax_rates within m3 . at the opposite_extreme is the modeling assumption that f admits a completely_additive structure with univariate components f ( x ) = f1 ( xi1 ) + ·_·_· + fd ( xid ) for which scalable_algorithms have_been_devised [ 12 ] and attractive minimax_risk bounds have_been_derived albeit under the strong assumption that all component functions fs have the same smoothness level [ 14 , 19 , 25 , 23 ] . imsart - generic_ver . 2014 / 01 / 08_file : minimax - final - arxiv _ version . tex_date_:_august 27 , 2014 y . yang and s . t . tokdar / 3 compared to either of these two_extremes , m3 providesBR10 − 5 ev k - 1 ) and is critical_temperature . therefore , for then . also , it can_be shown that , between and the below relation is satisfied : 21 , 23 ( 5 ) it has_been_shown that , the experimental values of for different materials and different direction in space generally fall in the range from to 5 ___ ___ _  1 / 2 ( ) 3 . 2 ( 1 ) bccttktt    bkctctt  ( ) 0t   ( 0 ) t _ ct ( 0 ) 1 . 76cbttk _  2  k3 . 0bckt , with most clustered near the bardeen , copper , and schrieffer ( bcs ) value of . 21 therefore , by assuming and using the above algorithm and eq . 5 , we find the and critical_temperature which are equal to 0 . 38 μ_ev and 0 . 25 k , respectively . we assume μ_ev in next calculations . also , in our_numerical_calculations , the electron energy range ( i . e . , - 1 to 1 ev ) is divided to 1000 equal parts . then for each value of energy and for each temperature value in kelvin , 1000 of twist_angles are chosen_randomly using gaussian_distribution . finally , the aboveBRphys . rev . a 81 ( 2010 ) 062320 ; j . doukas and l . c . l . hollenberg , loss of spin entanglement for accelerated_electrons in electric and magnetic_fields , phys . rev . a 79 ( 2009 ) 052109 .
