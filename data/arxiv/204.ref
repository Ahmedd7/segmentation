for systems which do_not_require coupling to states with large values of j . the dimensionality of the set of coupled equations grows_rapidly with increasing j due_to the exact treatment of the angular_momentum coupling , so it is also desirable to consider various decoupling approximations . one of the most_reliable decoupling approximations is the coupled states or centrifugal sudden ( cs ) approximation [ 20 – 22 ] which replaces the m - th channel orbital_angular_momentum lm with an average value l and reduces the channel index to include only the state quantum_numbers v and j . the infinite - order - sudden ( ios ) approximation [ 23 ] makes the additional approximation that the internal rotational energy is averaged_over so that the orientation_angle θ is treated_as a parameter . a more_severe ios approximation [ 24 ] averages_over both the internal rotational and vibrational energy so that the set of coupled equations ( 30 ) reduces to a set of uncoupled one - dimensional equations . this version was used by pack et_al . [ 1 ] to study tbr of ne2 due_to collisions with h , and it was estimated to be accurate to within about 20 % at_low_temperatures ( ∼ 30 k ) due_to the closely_spaced energies . the internal energies for h2 are not as closely_spaced , howeverBR. there is an equivalence of categories ( see [ sa1 , 2 . 2 . 10 ] ) dr − 1 y : dbf ( oy , diff ) ∼ − → dbf ( dy ) , with quasi - inverse given by the de_rham functor dr . here the source is the derived_category of bounded filtered differential complexes , and the target is the bounded_derived_category of filtered dy - modules dbf ( dy ) . its proof is quite elementary , and follows_from a rather trivial calculation of certain koszul_complexes . 4 m . saito in fact , for filtered oy - modules ( l , f ) , ( l ′ , f ) with f bounded below , ξ : (BRbasaran , o . a . 2002 drop formation from a capillary_tube : comparison of one - dimensional and two - dimensional analyses and occurrence of satellite drops . phys . fluids 14 , 2606 – 2621 . anna , s . l . , bontoux , n . &_stone , h . a . 2003 formation of dispersions using flow focusing in microchannels . appl . phys . lett . 82 , 364 –_366 . ashley , h . & landahl , m . 1965 aerodynamics of wings and bodies . adison - wesley_publishing_company , inc . , reading mass . usa . barrero , a . & loscertales , i . g . 2007 micro - and nanoparticles via capillary flows . annu . rev . fluid_mech . 39 , 89 – 106 . basaran , o . a . 2002 small - scale free surface flows with breakup : drop formation and emerging applications . aiche_j . 48 , 1842 – 1848 . buckmaster , j . d . 1971 pointed bubbles in slow viscous_flow . j . fluid_mech . 55 , 385_– 400 . gan ´ an calvo , a . m . 2008 unconditional jetting . phys . rev . e 78 , 026304 . castro - hern_´_andez , e . , campo - cort_´_es , f . &BR- ofmagnitude variations of τ , which is held_fixed throughout this analysis . this results from the significant gap_between hadronic and weak decay timescales . the coalescence function has a single parameter , the coalescence momentum p0 , which must_be fit to available collider data . following the approach of refs .
