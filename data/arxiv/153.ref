( 3 ) h4 = 1 for all h ∈ h ; therefore h is a non - solvable_group of exponent 4 generated_by involutions xi ( i ∈ n ) . note_that the relation ( 2 ) above is equivalent to say that xi is a left 2 - engel element of h that is [ x , xi , xi ] = 1 for all x ∈ h . we_do_not_know if h has the property requested in question 1 . 1 , that is , whether every involution u ∈ h is a left 2 - engel element of h . instead we find a quotient of h which is still non - solvable but it satisfies the latter property . the latter quotient of h will provide a counterexample for question 1 . 1 . to introduce the quotient weBRsome efforts_towards this direction . we_believe that besides the drastic slowing_down accompanied_by glass_transition , on which all the above theories put a focus , we should also consider another_important problem , namely , why some molecules do crystallize without vitrification and the others can_easily form glasses without crystallization . this is because ‘ not to crystallize on cooling ’ is the same as ‘ to vitrify ’ . since most glassforming molecules except for systems such as atactic polymers can crystallize under a certain condition , it is important for any physical model describing the glass_transition to explain_why crystallization is easily avoided in the socalled good glass_formers . all approaches ( a ) - ( e ) presuppose the avoidance of crystallization . this is partly_due_to a wide and basically correct belief that crystallization is avoided kinetically in vitrification in the spirit of classical_nucleation theory ( cnt ) . later , we will show that this is not_necessarily the whole_story and a thermodynamic factor associated_with frustration on crystallization ( more strictly , crystal - like bond_orientational_ordering ) may also play a crucial_role in the avoidance of crystallizationBRand sufficient_conditions for a steering_ellipsoid to represent a valid quantum state ( theorem 1 ) . the conditions relate the ellipsoid ’_s centre , semiaxes and orientation in a highly_non - trivial manner . we subsequently clarify these geometric constraints on physical states by considering the limits they impose on steering_ellipsoid volume for a fixed ellipsoid centre . this gives_rise_to a family of extremal volume states ( figure 3 ) which , in theorem 3 , quantum steering_ellipsoids , extremal physical states and monogamy 3 figure 1 . an example of the geometric data : alice_’ s steering_ellipsoid ea and the two bloch_vectors a and b . together_with a specification of bob_’_s local basis , this is a faithful_representation of two - qubit_states . allows_us_to place bounds on how large an ellipsoid may be before it becomes first entangled and then unphysical . the maximal volume states that we give in equation ( 11 ) are found to be very_special . in addition to being choi - isomorphic to the amplitudedamping channel , these states maximise concurrence over the set of all states that have steering_ellipsoids with a given centre ( theorem 5 ) . this endows steering_ellipsoid volume with a clear operational_meaning . a curious aside of the steering_ellipsoid formalism is its connection with classical euclidean_geometry . by investigating the geometry of separable steering_ellipsoids , in section 4 . 4 we arrive_at a novel derivation of a famous inequality of euler_’ s in two and three_dimensions . on a plane , it relates a triangle ’_s circumradius and inradius ; in three_dimensions , the result extends to tetrahedra and spheres . furthermore , we give a generalisation of euler_’ s result to ellipsoids , a
