( 2010 ) , the star_forming_sequence predicted by our_fiducial model has a larger intrinsic_scatter by ∆ σ ≈ 0 . 1 dex . dutton_et_al . ( 2010 ) explain that they expect their model to under - predict the scatter because their model features a simplified_treatment of the mass_assembly_histories of dark_matter_haloes , neglecting various_aspects of the hierarchical_galaxy_formation process that are included in galform . on the other_hand , we note_that the hydrodynamical_simulations presented in torrey_et_al . ( 2014 ) and obreja et_al . ( 2014 ) predict a larger_scatter of ≈ 0 . 3 dex . this could reflect a failing of the simplified_treatment of physical_processes used in galform when compared to a full hydrodynamical_simulation . the larger_scatter reported by torrey_et_al . ( 2014 ) is consistent_with the upper_limit on the intrinsic_scatter typically reported from observational_studies ( e . g noeske_et_al . 2007b ; whitaker_et_al . 2012 ) but it is difficult to accurately assess the true uncertainty on the star_formation_tracers used in these studies . for the purposes of this study , theBRby now note_that i . j = [ i ∈ j ω i = xi ∈ j ρ j = xi ∈ j ω i = ρ j . therefore the highest_weight_vector η j of the g - representation v ρ j can also be_viewed_as a highest_weight_vector for the g - representation v ρ j . > 0 u + , v ⊂ g > 0 u + , v . therefore we have an it_follows from [ rw08 , lemma 6 . 3 ] that we have an inclusion g embedding ( 17 ) p j u , v ; > 0 ֒_→ p j u , v ; > 0 ֒_→ p (BR1 . in appendix , we recall the precise_definition for the genus - 2 g - function . 1 preliminaries nius manifold h and their extensions to the big phase_space p : = q ∞ in this section we set up notations and review some basic structures for semisimple froben = 0 h . the first copy of h in the product defining p is usually identified with h itself , and is called the small phase_space . a basis { γ 1 , ·_·_· , γ n } of h induces a basis { τ n ( γ α ) 1 ≤ α ≤ n , n ≥ 0 } of p . the coordinates on p with respected to this basis is denoted_by ( t α n 1 ≤ α ≤ n , n ≥ 0 ) . this is called the flat coordinate_system on p . each τ n ( γ α ) can also be_viewed_as a coordinate vector_field on p and we identify τ 0 ( γ α ) with γ α . linear_combinations of γ α with coefficients being functions on p are called primary vector_fields . the product structure on frobenius_manifold h can_be naturally_extended to an_associative_product , denoted_by ” ◦ ” , on p using genus - 0 potential function f0 on the big phase_space ( cf . [ l02 ] ) . for a cohomological field_theory , f0 is the generating_function for genus - 0 descendent invariants . the product ” ◦ ” can_be used to define the quantum product of vector_fields on p . semisimplicity of h guaranteesBRthis market phenomenon is particularly_interesting from a theoretical_standpoint as_well as for the understanding of financial_market mechanisms . it_has_been_demonstrated that the currency_markets were indeed not respecting empirically a fundamental relation in finance which connects the currency_exchange_rates and the interest_rates associated_with two different countries . the main_contribution of this_article has_been to propose a rigorous statistical_modelling approach which captures the specific statistical features of both the individual currency log -
