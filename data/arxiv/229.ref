( 7 ) – ( 9 ) are reduced to those for standard inflation ξ = ξ , φ without the gauss - bonnet_coupling . = 0 , 4 fig . 1 : left : evolution of the slow - roll_parameters  and δ 1 for ξ ( φ ) = ξ 0e − λ φ with λ = − 0 . 1 . right : evolution of the slow - roll_parameters  and δ 1 for ξ ( φ ) = ξ 0 φ 2 . in this_work , we consider slow - roll_inflation with the inflaton_potential and gauss - bonnet_coupling satisfying the slow - roll approximations φ 2 / 2BR, non - linear , pde system for the vector unknown field v : ( 0 , t ) × rn → rn if we just simply regard x ( s ) as the spatial variable x . the natural condition for s = t provides the condition these computations show that if we put φ ξ ( x , v ( t , x ) ) = 0 . c ( x , v ) = φ ξ ξ ( x , v ) − 1 ( φ ξ x ( x , v ) v − φ x ( x , v )BRspacetimes are classic examples of this . among the things we discovered were new examples of the thermodynamic volume being distinct from the naive geometric volume , as found for the rotating case in ref . [ 11 ] . the presence of nut_charge generates contributions to the thermodynamic volume7 . for the taub – nut case , we even had the extreme case that the naive geometric volume is zero , while the thermodynamic volume is in fact non – zero and negative . in our dynamical setting , we interpreted8 the negative_sign as simply the result of the environment ( the rest of the universe ) doing work on the system to create the solution , which corresponds_to the universe having had to increase its volume . mechanical work is entirely natural in this extended setting , as discussed and exploited in ref . [ 20 ] . the picture we emphasise in all of this is that any gravity solution should_be able_to be_thought of as a result of a thermodynamic process , and its thermodynamic_properties interpreted in that light . one of the key points that emerges from this point of view is that certain puzzling thermodynamic features of the spacetimes are potentially explained in this setting : thermodynamic volumes can change dynamically ( in both directions ) , and heat_flows in and out of such volumes also now have natural meaning . this gives a dynamical origin for negative entropy of a spacetime solution , for example . a core idea was to take_seriously the relationship_between mass and enthalpy in this dynamical setting for spacetimes beyondBR, h − k , or g − i ) does_not_contain independent information on temperature and reddening ( or log g ) , introducing a bias_towards hotter , more_luminous stars evolving off the main_sequence . since temperature and reddening are degenerate , more_luminous and distant_stars with greater reddening and lower log g tend to be selected . to correct for this bias and ensure_consistency of the unclassified stars with the remaining sample , we apply an ad - hoc correction for hot_stars with the same form as adopted by p12 : teff , cor = 5800 k + 0 . 6 ( teff − 5800 k ) , ( 1 ) for all stars with teff > 5800 k . figure_5b shows a comparison of dsep temperatures with temperatures from p12 for a sample of giant_stars . we observe an offset , with dsep temperatures being significantly ( ∼ 80 k ) cooler_than the comparison values . this is consistent_with the offset_between temperatures derived_from the j − k infrared flux method and temperatures based_on sloan colors discussed by p12 . since the offset is generally within the adopted uncertainties , we did_not apply a systematic correction to temperatures of unclassified giant_stars . 5 . 3 . surface_gravities and metallicitiesBRis finite . if bn , j ≡ 1 then b - summability is basically ces_`_aro summability ( for nets ) , to a sum denoted_by s1 ( a ) . in the above definition , a can_be a net of scalars , vectors , matrices , or even distributions . in the latter_case the limit ( to be denoted_by w - lim ) is in the topology of weak_convergence of distributions , whereas in other cases the limit is in the component - wise ( point - wise for functions ) sense . remark 1 . an elementary extension of the classical toeplitz theorem shows that , if lim α a α = a ∞ and lim α b α = ∞ , then a is b - summable with the sum a ∞ . observe also that if both ab = { a α b α } and b are 1 - summable , and s1 ( b ) > 0 , then a will be b - summable as_well , with the sum sb ( a ) = s1 ( ab ) / s1 ( b ) . as we already_said , the weights wn , j can_be used to model dependence of the reproductive ability of individuals onBR( t ) √ ρ i ϕ vi , ui ϕ vi dx + si ( t ) 2 ρ i , si ( 1 ) = 0 .
