( 2002 , 2004 ) and wang et_al . ( 2003 ) , we also estimated the reconnection_electric_field , which is given by the product of separation speeds of the eit observed post - eruption ribbons and the magnetic_field_strength measured with mdi . this was_done for three points along the ribbons ( marked as a , b , and c in figures 3d and 4d ) . the average reconnection fields are estimated to be 0 . 04 , 0 . 03 , 0 . 03 v cm − 1 for the three points with a maximum less_than 0 . 07 v cm − 1 in event 10 . these values are 0 . 06 , 0 . 04 , 0 . 08 v cm − 1 with a maximum less_than 0 . 1 v cm − 1 in event 2 . nevertheless , due_to the noise_level of the mdi magnetic_field measurement , the error of the reconnection_electric_field measurement is notoriously large ( ∼ 0 . 1 v cm − 1 ) which is actually comparable to the physical values themselves . this prevents_us_from getting any meaningful conclusion of the variation trend of the electric_field . the only robust deduction is that the reconnection_electric_field remains weak during the reconnection_process . this is consistent_with the lack of significant emission enhancements in the x - rayBR; sterling et_al . 2011 ; tripathi_et_al . 2013 ) . 2 . 3 . kinematic evolution of the failed eruption we also study the kinematic evolution process of the flux_rope and its overlying loops . the heights of flux_rope apexes ( red plus_symbols shown in the right_panels of figure 1 ) and the inner_edge of the overlying loop arcades ( blue asterisk symbols shown in the bottom_panels of figure 1 ) are tracked in the aia_images and shown in figure 4 ( a ) . their velocities are shown in figure 4 ( b ) , along with the goes soft x - ray 1 - 8 a profile shown in the black_line . the velocities are calculated from the numerical_differentiation using the 3 - point lagrangian interpolation of the height - time data . note_that the uncertainties of the velocities come mainly from the uncertainties in the height measurement . the measurement_errors are estimated to be 2 pixels . these errors are propagated in the standard way to estimate the errors of velocity . the red , blue and black_filled_circles show the times of the maximum velocities of the flux_rope and overlying loops , and the peak of the soft x - ray_flux , respectively . from figure 4 ( a ) we find that the flux_rope started to show noticeable movement at 09 : 29 : 20 ut , and the loop_arcade , started to move at a later time at 09 : 30 : 11 ut . apparently , theBR48 ) and obtain for any g ∈ lc z γ 0 d ( η ) g ( η ) ( α c ) η d λ ( η ) ≤ z γ 0 α η xx ∈ η ≤ constz γ 0 a ( 1 + η ) n ν η − 1 g ( η ) c η d λ ( η ) g ( η ) c η d λ ( η ) < ∞ . the statement is proved . 29 proposition 3 . 14 . let ( 3 . 30 ) , ( 3 . 31 ) , and ( 3 . 45 ) hold with a1 + a2 α c < 3 2 ( 3 . 50 ) for some α ∈ ( 0 ; 1 ) . then ( bl , d α ) is a generator of a holomorphic semigroup bt α ( t ) on l α c . proof . the proof is similar to the proof of theorem 3 . 7 , taking_into_account that bounds ( 3 . 31 ) , ( 3 . 30 ) imply the same bounds for α c instead of c . note also that ( 3 . 50 ) is stronger_than ( 3 . 32 ) . proposition 3 . 15 . let ( 3 . 30 ) , ( 3 . 31 ) , and ( 3 . 45 ) hold with then , for any α with 1 ≤ ν < c a2 å 3 2 − a1 ã . a2 2 − a1 UNK < α < c UNK 3 1 ν , ( 3 . 51 ) ( 3 . 52 ) the resolvent of proof . first of all note_that the condition on α implies (BRrequiring modifications of the conventional mean - field analysis . 1 . analysis of degree - preferential pinning on scale - free networks we first discuss the dpp scheme on sfns generated_by the classic preferential - attachment rule [ 55 ] , with the degree distribution given by p ( k ) = 2m2 / k3 , where m is the number of edges each new node brings in as the system grows . the average degree of the network is hki = 2m , and the minimum degree is kmin = m . for dpp scheme from large to small degree , the density of pinned agents ρ pin and the minimum degree of pinned agents ( denoted_by k ′ ) are related to each_other as 6 1 0 . 1 pin mf1 & mf2 ( rp ) fcn sfn ( rp ) er ( rp ) sfn ( dpp ) er ( dpp ) ( a ) 104 2 103_102 ( b ) 104_103 2 102 0 . 01 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 pin fig . 3 : ( color_online ) . modified cumulative variance σ 2 [ eq .
