to determine , given two mixedstate quantum_circuits q0 , q1 and constants a < b , whether kq0 − q1k ⋄ ≤ a or kq0 − q1k ⋄ ≥ b . these distinguishability problems were_originally shown to be hard for the complexity class qip of languages decided by quantum interactive proof systems , but this class was later proven to equal pspace [ 94 ] . the proof technique of [ 137 ] starts by using a result of kitaev and watrous [ 102 ] , which states that all quantum_interactive_proofs can_be parallelized to three rounds . a mathematical reformulation of this result is that the close images problem is qip - hard . this problem is defined as follows : given two quantum_circuits q0 , q1 and constants a < b , distinguish_between the cases that there is an input ρ such that f ( q0 ( ρ ) , q1 ( ρ ) ) ≥ b , or that for all inputs ρ , f ( q0 ( ρ ) , q1 ( ρ ) ) ≤ a . hardness of quantum_circuit distinguishability is then shown by a reduction from close images [ 137 ] . 49 on the other_hand , recent_work by hayden et_al . [ 85 ] demonstrates that quantum property testers can_be used to prove positive results regarding the complexity of testing properties of quantum_circuits . the problem considered by these authors is a variant of the separability - testing problem ( cf . sections 4 . 1 . 2 and 4 . 2 ) . in this variant the input is the description of a mixed - state quantum_circuit q on n qubits , and one_considers the output of theBRs − r − u is a lattice vector . we_already_know that s , p , u are distinct . we must show that none of s , u equals r ( we pointed_out above that r 6 = p ) . if r = s then u = p , which is not possible . if r = u then u = r = 2p , which is not possible . thus p + s − r − u is a minimal vector . we have shown that if p = q , then v is the difference of two minimal vectors . next assume_that r = q ∞ , so v = − p − q + 2q ∞ and p + q = q ∞ . since e contains_at_least 5 rational places , we can choose a rational point u different from the points q ∞ , p , q , 2p . put s : = q + u and note_that u 6 = s otherwise q = q ∞ . also q +BR( 1 ) on e r . by [ 11 , lemma 2 . 4 . ii ] , the spectral subspace assumption guarantees that this action induces a ∗ - homomorphism a ⋊ u ( 1 ) → kf ( e r ) . we let g denote the associated ( a ⋊ u ( 1 ) , f ) - hilbert c ∗ - module . we denote the associated class in k k - theory by [ g ] ∈ k k u ( 1 ) ( a ⋊ u ( 1 ) , f ) . let_us_remark that g = e r as banach_spaces and as ( a , f ) - bimodules we have the equality 0 ( 3 . 24 ) a ⊗ a g = e r . lemma 3 . 3BRaccelerated_expansion of the universe can_be realized by the growth of v . in order to avoid an early entry to the phase of cosmic_acceleration , the graviton_mass m is required to be very much_smaller_than the today_’ s hubble_parameter_h0 . we showed_that the equation of state of this “ dark ” component evolves as wde = − 1 . 791 ( radiation_era ) , wde = − 1 . 725 ( matter_era ) , and wde = − 1 . 506 ( accelerated era ) , see fig . 1 . while the above property of the non - local massive_gravity is attractive , theBR) , where the mean_value is given by a linear function of x , fa ( x ) = x + bag , with a coefficient , ba = di j / ( 2af ) , which just shifts the pdf by bag , i . e . pf + d ( x ) = pf ( x − bag ) , as shown in fig . 1 ( b ) ∗ ∗ . ′ x ) = d ( x on the other_hand , the cpds for non - affine deformations can_be measured through scatter_plots of the scaled overlaps , see figures 2 ( a ) and ( b ) , where the four_kinds of changes are mapped_onto four regions : ( cc ) x , x ′ < 0 , ( vc ) x < 0 , x ′ < 0 , respectively . in ( cc ) and ( vv ) , the scaled overlaps after compression distribute around mean values which we describe by linear fitting functions for ′ , ′ > 0 , and ( cv ) x > 0 , x ′ > 0 , ( vv ) x , x fn ( x ) = ( an + 1 ) x + bn , ( 3 ) where the subscripts , n = c and v , represent the mean values in ( cc ) and ( vv ) , respectively . if we introduce standard_deviations of x ′ from fn ( x ) as vn , which are almost independent ofBRex → x , ´_etale in codimension_one , such that for any locally_free , flat , analytic sheaf g ◦ on exan sheaf g an on exan such that g anxan and thm . 5 . 9 ] , that there_exists a coherent , reflexive , algebraic sheaf g on ex whose analytification over exreg equals g ◦ , the claim will then follow . let ex → x be any cover for which the assertions of theorem 1 . 4 hold_true . to shorten_notation , we denote the relevant complex spaces by y : = exan and y ◦ : = exan and section 10 . 1 . 1 that the induced_morphism of ´_etale_fundamental_groups , b ι ∗ : b π 1 ( y ◦ ) → b π 1 ( y ) , is isomorphic . gl UNK rank f , c UNK . we write g : = img ( ρ ◦ ) . the group g is a quotient of the ficonsequently , the profinite_completion morphism a : g → bg is injective , [ rz10 , nitely generated group π 1 ( y ◦ ) , hence finitely_generated . as a subgroup of the general linear group , g is residually_finite by malcev ’_s theorem , [ weh73 , thm . 4 . 2 ] . by definition 1 . 14 , the sheaf g ◦ corresponds_to a representation ρ ◦ : π 1 ( y ◦ ) → sect . 3 . 2 ] . ´_etale_fundamental_groups , flat sheaves , and quotients of abelian_varieties 29 to giveBR, u ∗ h − uhi + h σ h , u ∗ − 1 − 2k ∇ ( u ∗ h − uhi ≥ h σ , u ∗ h − uhi h − uh ) k2 + h σ h , u ∗ h − uhi . therefore 1 8k σ − σ hk2 h σ − σ h , u − uhi ≥ − 1 8k σ − σ hk2 ≥ − + h σ h − ¯ σ h , ( u ∗ h − uh ) k2 + h σ h , ( u ∗ h − uh ) k2 + h ¯ σ h , ( u ∗ − 1 − 2k ∇ ( u ∗ − 1 − 2k ∇ ( u ∗ h − uh ) − ( u − uh ) i . h − uh ) − ( u − uh ) i h − uh ) − ( u − uh ) i notice_that h σ h − ¯ σ h , ( u ∗ h − uh ) − ( u ∗ h − uh ) k + k ∇ ( u − uh )BRwhat is now pakistan and india ( figure 1 ) . one of its most_interesting features is several large and medium - sized settlements in the present_day gujarat region in what is called the kutch ( chakrabarti , 2004 ;
