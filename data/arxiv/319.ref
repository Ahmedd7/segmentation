k ∈ n ) . we are_interested in the case when the ultimate period is 1 , or in other_words , when the orbit is ultimately stable . note_that in this case the ultimate vector of the orbit necessarily satisfies a ⊗ x = x . this is the main_reason 4 why in this_paper by eigenvectors we mean fixed_points .
