( 2009 ) and masciadri_et_al . ( 2010 ) , respectively for mauna_kea and mount graham , presented high vertical resolution turbulence profiles . the sutherland site differs signifcantly from those two sites due_to its strong upper ground layer located_at 300 to 500 m . the sutherland upper gl contributes nearly 50_% of the gl turbulence while it is only 2 % and 12 % for mauna_kea and mount graham , respectively . most of the turbulence at those sites is located in the lower layers , 90_% in the first 40 m for mauna_kea and 70_% in the first 100 m for mount graham , compare to 30 % in the first 100 m at sutherland . 14 l . catala et_al . figure 10 . wind_direction and seeing . wind_direction frequencies duringBRas_well [ 36 ] . strictly_speaking , the lattice data shown here was obtained for the pure su ( 2 ) gauge_theory , while our dse calculations refer to su ( 3 ) . at the present accuracy level , this difference is not significant , however . the renormalized propagators of the two basically coincide [ 23 ] . for completeness we provide corresponding dse results for su ( 2 ) , which indeed compare equally_well with the lattice data , in the supplemental_material .
