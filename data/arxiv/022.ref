UNK 12 alaste we defined the function bf by choosing any element from the set c . since bf is unique , the set c must_be a singleton for every p ∈ δ x . although the evaluation mapping e need not be injective , we call the function bf an extension of f to δ x . following theorem can_be deduced using the stone - weierstrass theorem . however , we present the following proof using only properties of f - filters instead of the stoneBR, 1 ] , and c1 is some user - defined positive_constant independent of n ∈ n . for reasons of simplicity , let_us_fix c1 = 1 . then [ 7 , cor . 4 . 12 ] gives learning_rates for the risk of svms for τ - quantile_regression , if a single gaussian rbf - kernel on x ⊂_rd is used for τ - quantile functions of p - average type 2 with p = ∞ , which are of order c2n  − α es ( d , α ) , where α es ( d , α ) = 2 α 2 α + d . hence the learning_rate in theorem 3 is better_than the one in [ 7 , cor . 4 . 12 ] in this situation , if α ( r , β es ( d , α , θ ) , θ , ζ ) > α es ( d , α ) , provided the assumption of the additive model is valid . table 1 lists the values of α ( r , β es ( d , α , θ ) , θ , ζ ) from ( 2 . 14 ) for some finite values of the dimension d , where α ∈ [ 1 , ∞ ) . all of these values of α ( r , β es ( d , α , θ ) , θ , ζ ) are positive with the exceptions if θBR m UNK mcqqc  m  c  m UNK mctvcv  t _ d  m UNK mctvcv  t  3 a definition of critical velocity different from the definition ( 13 ) was_suggested in [ 9 , 10 ] . we compare the two definitions in the appendix and prove their equivalence in the limit of vanishing impurity - host coupling , provided the excitations of the host fluid are local . the argument by landau reviewed above suggest that the impurity moves without dissipation when v0 < vc . however this argument is not rigorous since the kinetic_energy is not an integral of motion . our_aim is to derive a rigorous relation_between v0 and v ∞ . to this end we prove the following theorem . consider an impurity particle immersed in a host fluid . the combined impurity - host system is described by the hamiltonian ( 1 ) and prepared in the initial_state ( 9 ) with v0 ≡ v0 < vc . assume_that the eigenvalues of the total hamiltonian h corresponding to a total momentum mv0 are nondegenerate . then the difference_between the initial and infinitetime velocities of the impurity is bounded from above according_to v0 − v ∞ ≤ UNK UNK gs , v0 ugs , v0 UNK − UNK UNK UNK gs , v0e UNK UNK UNK 2 UNK e ue UNK UNK 1 , m ( vc − v0 ) UNK e UNK ( 15 ) fig . 2 .
